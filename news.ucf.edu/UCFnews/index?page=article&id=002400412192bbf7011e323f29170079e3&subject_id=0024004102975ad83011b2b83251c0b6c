			<p><em>UCF Vice President and Chief of Staff Beth Barnes gave the following commencement address on Monday afternoon. She spoke to graduates of the&nbsp;College of Arts and Humanities, College of Hospitality Management, College of Sciences, Undergraduates Studies, and College of Graduate Studies.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, President Hitt.&nbsp; Congratulations, graduates, there is much that I wish for you today, not the least of which is that you find a career that is as enriching, stimulating, and rewarding as mine has been at UCF.</p>
<p>Trustees, colleagues, graduates, family members and friends, my first lecture here was in the fall of 1968 when we opened our doors as FTU and I was a young English professor.&nbsp; I am honored to have the opportunity to give this, my last lecture 40 years later at this commencement. And, graduates, what I have to say will be a little bit of a lecture because I want to give you some advice before we send you on your way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago, I heard a UCF commencement address entitled Bloom Where You&rsquo;re Planted.&nbsp; It was excellent. Yet, as I listened, I thought that if I were ever given the opportunity, I would use the same title but approach the subject differently.&nbsp; What I have to say to you is not better, just different.</p>
<p>There is an African proverb that says, &ldquo;If I am to be prince, and you are to be prince, who is to drive the donkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp; it seems that everyone wants to start at the top. I&rsquo;m always shocked at what students tell me about their expectations in their first job after graduation:&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to make six figures.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want a corner office.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want an entry level position; I want to be the boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dean Morrison-Shetlar didn&rsquo;t start at the top; President Hitt didn&rsquo;t start at the top; President-Elect Obama didn&rsquo;t start at the top.&nbsp; Most of you won&rsquo;t start at the top, either.&nbsp; Generally, you start at the bottom and work your way up.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s how it should be.&nbsp; Because, like it or not, there are things you can learn and dues you probably need to pay.&nbsp; But, wherever it is you are, wherever it is you get to start:&nbsp; Bloom where you&rsquo;re planted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, wherever you&rsquo;re planted, don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my job.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Humpf!&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t pay me enough money to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t pay you enough money--and with that attitude, I never will!</p>
<p>My husband was driving home one weekend several years ago, and he asked a rest-stop security guard for change so he could get some crackers.&nbsp; The guard said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my job.&nbsp; You can use that change machine.&rdquo;&nbsp; John put his $5.00 bill in the machine and, of course, you know what happened.&nbsp; &ldquo;The machine kept my bill,&rdquo; he said to the guard. &ldquo;Can you get it back for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my job,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you know the machine was out of order when you told me to use it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you put an &lsquo;out of order&rsquo; sign on it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my job, either.&rdquo;&nbsp; That guard is really going far in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my computer, I have a very illustrative picture of a highway with freshly painted yellow center stripes.&nbsp; And there in the middle of the road is a flattened armadillo with the stripes painted right over it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you just hear it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, man, I just paint the stripes.&rdquo;&nbsp; That picture won the Colorado &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not My Job&rdquo; Award.</p>
<p>You know what? It is your job. First of all, because it ought to be.&nbsp; But also because people will be watching.&nbsp; Your supervisors care if you care.&nbsp; They want you to succeed.&nbsp; They expect you to own your job.&nbsp; They expect you to move the armadillo if it&rsquo;s in the way of your road-painting machine.&nbsp; And, who cares whose job it is if it needs to be done?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s important is that the job be done right and that it reflect well on the unit or the company.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s important is that you do the right thing. And if that&rsquo;s moving a dead armadillo, then move the dead armadillo.</p>
<p>Let it be your job. View it as an opportunity.&nbsp; Be the best that you can be at whatever you do. Bloom where you&rsquo;re planted. And if it IS your job, don&rsquo;t let it be your job NOT to do.&nbsp; President Hitt is fond of saying that:&nbsp; &ldquo;Something can&rsquo;t be your job NOT to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; Think about it.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you some of my story, not because there&rsquo;s anything remarkable about it, but because it&rsquo;s the story I know best:&nbsp; I put myself through college and I was always scrambling to fill in the gaps of my scholarship.&nbsp; I had a job as a student assistant in the psych department, but I needed full-time summer work to pay fall&rsquo;s tuition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you can have a full-time student assistantship, BUT, in addition to your regular duties, you&rsquo;ll have to feed and water the laboratory rats and clean their cages.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wanted to make them all pets, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>I needed the money, so, I was the best lab-rat-wrangler and rat-cage-cleaner I could be.&nbsp; I even had to go in on weekends to care for them.&nbsp; They were in these triple tiers of cages with paper under each cage.&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t potty trained.&nbsp; I pulled the soiled paper out one end of the rack and then pulled clean paper through.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t too bad.&nbsp; Only this one Sunday, I took the soiled paper out, rolled it up, put it in the garbage can, and forgot to replace it with the clean paper.</p>
<p>Get the picture?&nbsp; Top tier to middle tier to bottom tier of cages.&nbsp; I was certainly blooming where I was planted--and now they were!&nbsp; There was enough fertilizer on those rats for anything to bloom!&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I still got LOTS of points with the faculty for being willing to do that job.&nbsp; And I made my tuition.</p>
<p>After I finished my master&rsquo;s degree, I taught at UCF for 4 years, and then I took a leave of absence to get my Ph.D. in British literature at the University of North Carolina.&nbsp; I was divorced and getting no child support for my two little girls.&nbsp; And, although I had a graduate assistantship at Chapel Hill, we were poor.&nbsp; I kept telling the children the situation would improve when we got back to Orlando and I started teaching again.&nbsp; But I got back in May and my contract as a professor didn&rsquo;t start until August.&nbsp; I needed to go to work THEN.&nbsp; My children liked to eat and my landlord expected me to pay rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; said my department chair, &ldquo;I can give you a job, BUT (where had I heard that before) there are no teaching jobs available this summer.&nbsp; You can be the department secretary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Secretary?&nbsp; Look, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being a secretary, but I had all but completed my Ph.D. in eighteenth century British literature and had great hopes of teaching the heroic couplet and the picaresque novel!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, I had no choice.&nbsp; So, for that summer, I was the best secretary I could possibly be.&nbsp; I answered phones. I ordered textbooks. I took messages for my peers. I typed their tests and letters.&nbsp; A couple of them even had the gall to dictate letters to me!&nbsp; But it was my job and I did it with a smile, although sometimes a forced one.&nbsp; My once and future fellow faculty members also had me grade their papers and advise their students, which was not exactly in the job description. I might have said &ldquo;Hey, they don&rsquo;t pay me enough to grade your papers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, I accepted the job, didn&rsquo;t I, and I knew how to grade papers.&nbsp; And they weren&rsquo;t asking me to do anything illegal, immoral, dangerous, or distasteful.</p>
<p>And you know what, that summer was very good for me in the long run. Personally, it was a means to an end. It fed my children, paid the rent, and provided us with health insurance that, it turned out, we would desperately need.</p>
<p>It was good for me professionally. And I stress that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to see my future students, my chairman, and my department from a different perspective.&nbsp; I had always seen it solely from a faculty member&rsquo;s point of view.&nbsp; It gave me some very crucial experience that I needed when I became Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies a few years later. In many ways, I was ahead of the learning curve on a number of administrative matters.&nbsp; And look how that has ultimately paid off for me.</p>
<p>Dr. Armando Payas, a former chair of UCF&rsquo;s foreign language department, immigrated to the U.S. in the 1960&rsquo;s. He had been a wealthy attorney and a professor in Cuba and he arrived in the U.S. with nothing-- as did so many who fled Castro.&nbsp; He was hired to teach Spanish at USF and his department chairman took him into his home to live until he could get on his feet financially.&nbsp; One day Dr. Payas was found vacuuming the living room to show his appreciation for all that had been done for him.&nbsp; In Cuba, he had had servants and now he was vacuuming&mdash;apparently for the first time in his life, because he had tried to vacuum the drapes and sucked them right off the rods into the vacuum cleaner!</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce Clampitt, former interim vice president of Administration and Finance at UCF, picked up trash on the campus and pulled weeds anytime she saw them.&nbsp; Yes, pulled weeds.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my job; I&rsquo;ve got groundskeepers to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She cared more about this place than she did her image.&nbsp; And I suspect those qualities are part of why she was a vice president and others weren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Weeds were NOT going to bloom on her campus.</p>
<p>The point is: someone has to do it.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t YOU do it?&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? Say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it; let me try.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, deliver what you promise.&nbsp; Deliver more than the next person. People will learn to rely on you. &ldquo;Who should work on this project?&nbsp; Susan! We can always count on Susan.&rdquo; And, before long, that reliance on you will become &ldquo;Susan is the perfect person to manage this project!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Gardner has written a lot about leadership and he says it is&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;not a mysterious activity.&rdquo;&nbsp; I.e., leadership can be learned.&nbsp; By watching others, asking questions, trying things out.&nbsp; By taking it one step at a time. By always doing just a little more than is required. By taking responsibility. And I would add, by blooming where you&rsquo;re planted, wherever that may be.</p>
<p>Let me close with a little story that you may have heard President Hitt tell, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating and it underscores what I&rsquo;ve been saying to you:</p>
<p>A prominent person once summed up his success in three simple words:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then some.</p>
<p>He discovered at an early age, he said, that most of the difference between average people and top people could be explained in these simple three words.</p>
<p>The top people did what was expected of them -- and then some.</p>
<p>They were thoughtful of others; they were considerate and kind -- and then some.</p>
<p>They met their obligations and responsibilities fairly and squarely -- and then some.</p>
<p>They were good friends to their friends -- and then some.</p>
<p>They could be counted on in an emergency -- and then some.</p>
<p>Three little words -- and then some.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could transform our society as well as your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, UCF grads, my hope for you is that you will bloom where you&rsquo;re planted, achieve your goals, live your dreams, do great things, and then some.</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
