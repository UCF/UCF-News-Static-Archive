			<p>The UCF Knights will kick off the 2009 season Saturday, Sept. 5, when they will face Samford at 7:30 p.m. at Bright House Networks Stadium.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the first two seasons on campus, most of the game day policies and procedures this year will be familiar to fans. The most significant change involves the time when campus parking lots will open and tailgating can begin.</p>
<p>For the Samford game and others that kick off at 6 p.m. or later, parking lots will open and tailgating can begin at noon. For games that kick off before 6 p.m., parking lots will open and tailgating can begin at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>For the Samford game, no tailgating set up can begin prior to noon.</p>
<p>Although the length of UCF&rsquo;s tailgating period has been slightly reduced, the new policy enables fans to continue enjoying UCF&rsquo;s outstanding tradition of on-campus tailgating. The policy is consistent with what many other universities around the country allow.</p>
<p>UCF will also continue last year&rsquo;s policy of waiving county open container ordinances for alcohol from the time tailgating begins until kick off. Alcohol cannot be consumed in campus tailgating areas after kick off.</p>
<p>University administrators worked closely with athletics, alumni and student leaders and community members to develop responsible policies that best support the university, fans and neighbors.</p>
<p>Campus parking lots again will close two hours after each game, or midnight, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by anyone younger than 21. Anyone consuming alcohol must be prepared to show proof that he or she is 21 or older.</p>
<p>Glass containers of any type, kegs and beer funnels are not allowed on campus.</p>
<p>For a full list of tailgating regulations, go to <a href="http://www.UCFGameday.com">www.UCFGameday.com</a> and click on the &lsquo;Tailgating&rsquo; link under the Game Day tab.</p>
<p><strong>Game Day Fan Help Desk: </strong>UCF will continue to operate a telephone help desk that will be active on home football game days. Anyone with questions about game days can call 407-882-FANS (3267).</p>
<p><strong>Game Day Text Message Help:</strong> UCF Athletics and partner In Stadium Solutions have established a text-message communication system for fans. Beginning two hours before each game, fans can send a text message to &ldquo;41513&rdquo; and type &ldquo;UCF&rdquo; followed by a brief description of the issue and its location in the stadium. Ushers, public safety or first-aid personnel, or other event staff&nbsp;will respond as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Policy:</strong> Animals, except for service animals, are not allowed on campus on game days. Anyone who brings an animal that is not a service animal will be asked to take it home.</p>
<p><strong>Parking:</strong> Parking policies are virtually the same as they were in 2008. Parking is divided into three sections -- Gold, Red and Blue. The Gold Zone, closest to Bright House Networks Stadium, requires a reserved game day parking permit and is only for members of the Golden Knights Club, credentialed media, stadium operations personnel, patrons with disabilities and students with special permits.</p>
<p>Anyone parked in the Gold Zone who does not meet the above criteria will be towed as early as 5 a.m. on game days. The Gold Zone includes surface parking lots C 1-2, D 1-2 and E 1-8, as well as parking garages C, D and F. This does not apply to Towers residents who have reserved parking spaces in Garages E and G. They are allowed to remain in their reserved spaces.</p>
<p>Almost all parking in the Red Zone and Blue Zone is open to everyone. The spaces are free and on a first-come, first-served basis. Parking Garage B, located across from the Recreation and Wellness Center, is reserved for university business.</p>
<p>Parking is not allowed along campus roadways, in residential housing parking lots or garages, or on any open grassy areas throughout campus (except for designated E-lots in the Gold Zone).</p>
<p><strong>Park and Ride: </strong>Fans are invited to park at off-site parking lots conveniently located in the Research Park. Free UCF Shuttles will continuously transport passengers from the Orlando Tech Center in the Research Park to the on-campus Health Center stop (lot C3). Game day service will be available from three hours prior to game start until two hours after game end.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic: </strong>Traffic patterns before and after games are virtually the same as in 2008. Preferred routes for each of the three parking zones and campus road closures that occur on game days are listed at <a href="http://www.UCFGameday.com">www.UCFGameday.com</a>.</p>
<p>UCF will operate shuttles for students to and from several nearby apartment complexes, from five hours prior to the start of the game until two hours after the game ends. The service is free. The on-campus shuttle routes (Black and Gold routes) will not be operating on game days.</p>
<p><strong>Fans with disabilities:</strong> Parking for fans with disabilities is available on the first floor of Garage D across from the UCF Arena. Fans with valid handicapped parking permits are allowed to enter the Gold Zone via Libra Drive or North Orion Boulevard to access Garage D. While there are other handicapped parking spaces located throughout the campus, shuttles to and from the stadium will be available only from Garage D.</p>
<p><strong>Knights Pick Up: </strong>To keep the campus clean, a roving trash and recycling pick-up team called &quot;Knights Pick Up&quot; will travel around Memory Mall every few hours. Most Knights fans have done a great job keeping their areas clean by disposing of trash and recyclables. We encourage all fans to embrace the &quot;Knights Pick Up&quot; service and help recycling crews by regularly cleaning up their tailgating areas.</p>
<p><strong>UCF&rsquo;s Neighbors: </strong>Fans should be respectful of UCF&rsquo;s neighbors and are advised to park on campus for free and not in surrounding neighborhoods. Fans also are reminded that Orange and Seminole counties' ordinances prohibit open containers of alcohol on public streets or parking lots.</p>
<p><strong>Student Government Activities:</strong> The UCF Student Government Association tailgate area on the south end of Memory Mall will open at noon and will include a live band, face painting and free barbecue food for students. At 4 p.m., fans can help to select the SGA&rsquo;s Fan of the Game, a scholarship award given to the Knights&rsquo; most spirited student fan. The SGA tailgate will conclude at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Freshman Frenzy:</strong> Freshman Frenzy, an event that helps new students learn UCF&rsquo;s game day songs and other traditions, will start at 5 p.m. at the Venue. Other fans are invited to attend.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Knights Club Pregame Hospitality:</strong> The Golden Knights Club will host its pre-game hospitality event at the Black &amp; Gold Club in the UCF Arena from 4 to 7 p.m. Saturday. The event is open to GKC donors at the Noble Level and above.&nbsp; Visit the GKC section at <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>UCF Alumni Association Pregame Party: </strong>The UCF Alumni Association will host a pregame party at the Fairwinds Alumni Center from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Saturday. Visit <a href="http://www.ucfalumni.com">www.ucfalumni.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Smokey Bones Tailgate Show:&nbsp;</strong> The Smokey Bones Tailgate Show will start at 5:30 p.m. at IOA Plaza, in front of Bright House Networks Stadium.&nbsp; The pre-game radio show features the &ldquo;Voice of the Knights&rdquo; Marc Daniels, along with sideline reporter Jerry O&rsquo;Neill, game analyst Gary Parris and studio host Scott Adams. The show will include guest segments from UCF football alumni, UCF Director of Athletics Keith Tribble and other UCF athletics features. While at the Smokey Bones Tailgate Show, check out some of the other corporate sponsors at the ISP Sports Fan Faire and receive one of several game day giveaways that will be distributed.</p>
<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> Season tickets, three-game mini packs and single-game tickets are available for UCF football games. Call 407-823-1000 or log onto <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Students can purchase season tickets or enter a weekly lottery for free tickets to each home game. The deadline to sign up for the lottery for the Samford game has passed. Students can sign up for the lottery for the Sept. 19 home game against Buffalo from Sept. 6 to 9. Visit <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a> for more information.</p>
