			<p>The UCF Knights will host the University of South Florida Bulls at 7 p.m. Saturday at Bright House Networks Stadium.</p>
<p>The game will be televised nationally on ESPN2, and UCF encourages fans to arrive early and get to their seats before kickoff.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the inaugural season on campus, most of the game day policies and procedures this year will be familiar to fans. One notable change is that the waiver of open container laws for alcohol will end at kickoff. Tailgating can continue, but not with alcohol.</p>
<p>UCF also is reminding fans that animals, except for service animals, are not allowed on campus on game day. Fans who bring animals to campus will be asked to take them home.</p>
<p>Up-to-date information and procedures are available at <a href="http://www.UCFGameday.com">www.UCFGameday.com</a>. UCF also will continue to operate a telephone help desk that will be active on home football game days. Anyone with questions about game days can call 407-882-FANS (3267).</p>
<p><b>Tickets:</b> A limited number of tickets are available and can be purchased online at <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a> or by calling Ticketmaster at 407-839-3900. The UCF Athletics Ticket Box Office is located in Bright House Networks Stadium on the ground floor off the IOA west entry plaza by gate 1.</p>
<p>Students can purchase season tickets or enter a weekly lottery for free tickets to each home game. The deadline to sign up for the lottery for the South Florida game was Thursday, Aug. 28. Lottery signups for the next game, against Southern Methodist on Oct. 4, will be held from Sept. 21 to 24. Visit <a href="http://www.KnightTickets.com">www.KnightTickets.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p><b>Parking:</b> Parking policies are virtually the same as they were in 2007. There will be about 12,000 parking spots available on campus. Parking is divided into three sections -- Gold, Red and Blue. The Gold Zone, closest to Bright House Networks Stadium, requires a reserved game day parking permit and is only for members of the Golden Knights Club, credentialed media, stadium operations personnel, patrons with disabilities and students with special permits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone parked in the Gold Zone who does not meet the above criteria will be towed as early as 5 a.m. on game days. The Gold Zone includes surface parking lots C 1-2, D 1-2 and E 1-8 in addition to parking garages C, D and F. This does not apply to Towers residents who have reserved parking spaces in Garages E and G. They are allowed to remain in their reserved spaces.</p>
<p>Almost all parking in the Red Zone and Blue Zone is open to everyone. The spaces are free and on a first-come, first-served basis. Parking Garage B, located across from the Recreation and Wellness Center, is reserved for official university business. Vehicles parked illegally in Garage B will be towed as early as 5 a.m. on game days.</p>
<p>Parking is not allowed along campus roadways, in residential housing parking lots or garages, or on any open grassy areas throughout campus.</p>
<p><b>Traffic:</b> Traffic patterns before and after games are virtually the same as in 2007, but UCF will open up some campus roadways to traffic during games.</p>
<p>Preferred routes for each of the three parking zones are listed at <a href="http://www.UCFGameday.com">www.UCFGameday.com</a>, and fans are encouraged to follow them.</p>
<p>Here are the key street closures that occur on game days. These are similar to last year&rsquo;s traffic policies, except that these roads will be open from game start until midway through the 4th quarter.</p>
<p>Gemini Boulevard North will be closed to vehicle traffic from Alafaya Trail to North Orion Boulevard from three hours prior to the start of the game until game start and again from the middle of the fourth quarter until two hours after the game ends. This road closure is designed to ensure pedestrian safety between the main and north sections of campus.</p>
<p>Gemini Blvd East (from Libra Drive to North Orion Blvd) and North Orion Boulevard (from McCulloch Road to Gemini Boulevard North) will only be accessible to vehicles displaying valid Gold Zone credentials from three hours prior to the start of the game until game start and again from midway through the 4th quarter until two hours after the game.</p>
<p>Students who live in the Towers asked for more access to and from their residence halls on game days, and UCF can accommodate them this season. Towers residents will be able to get to and from their garages at any time on game days through the following routes:</p>
<p>Towers 1 &amp; 2 (Garage G): Enter and return via West Plaza Drive to/from North Orion Boulevard unless directed by law enforcement personnel to use Gemini Boulevard North.</p>
<p>Towers 3 &amp; 4 (Garage E): Enter and return via Tower Street to/from North Orion Boulevard.</p>
<p>UCF will operate about 25 shuttle buses for students to and from several nearby apartment complexes, from five hours prior to the start of the game until three hours after the game ends. The service is free. The on-campus shuttle routes (Black and Gold routes) will not be operating on game days.</p>
<p><b>Fans with disabilities:</b> Parking for fans with disabilities is available on the first floor of Garage D across from the UCF Arena. Fans with valid handicapped parking permits are allowed to enter the Gold Zone via Libra Drive or North Orion Boulevard to access Garage D. While there are other handicapped parking spaces throughout the campus, shuttles to and from the stadium will be available only from Garage D.</p>
<p><b>Sportsmanship:</b> Most fans behave responsibly and are great ambassadors for UCF, and the university expects that will continue this season. UCF will encourage fans to demonstrate good sportsmanship and welcome fans from opposing team through several initiatives this year. Our themes for the &ldquo;Do the Knight Thing&rdquo; campaign will be Honor UCF, Respect the Opponent and Be a Good Sport. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.dotheknightthing.com">www.dotheknightthing.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Tailgating:</b> Tailgating activities are allowed from 7 a.m. until two hours after the game ends. However, the waiver of open container laws for alcohol will end at the start of the game this season. Tailgating activities are allowed in any ground-level parking lot or open grassy area. They are not permitted in any parking garage on any level. Tailgating activities without vehicles are allowed on most other areas on campus.</p>
<p>Only fans 21 and older are permitted to drink alcoholic beverages. Kegs, beer funnels and glass containers are not allowed on campus.</p>
<p>Fans should recycle plastic and aluminum cans in the &quot;UCF Recycles!&quot; containers located around campus and in the stadium.</p>
<p>For a more detailed story on tailgating, click <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=00240041024ef606c011bdca71466047b&amp;subject_id=0024004102975ad83011b2b83251c0c35">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Neighbors:</b> Fans should be respectful of UCF&rsquo;s neighbors and are advised to park on campus for free and not in surrounding neighborhoods. Law-enforcement officers will be patrolling local subdivisions on game day to encourage fans not to block driveways or park on private property.</p>
<p>Orange and Seminole counties' ordinances prohibit open containers of alcohol on public streets or parking lots.</p>
<p><b>Animal policy:</b> Animals, except for service animals, are not allowed on campus on game day. A service animal is not a pet; rather, a service animal is an animal that is trained to perform tasks for an individual with a disability. For the full animal policy, click <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/animal-policy.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Security:</b> Law enforcement officers from the UCF Police Department, Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, Seminole County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, Oviedo Police Department, Florida Highway Patrol and state Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco will work hard to ensure a safe and secure environment for all fans, a smooth flow of exciting activities and efficient management of traffic flow.</p>
<p><b>Prohibited Items in Stadium:</b> To ensure that all guests have a safe and enjoyable visit to Bright House Networks Stadium, guests are not allowed to bring alcoholic beverages; horns, whistles or artificial noisemakers; food and drink; video cameras and camcorders; and many other items. For a full list, go to <a href="http://www.UCFGameday.com">www.UCFGameday.com</a> and click on &ldquo;Prohibited Items&rdquo; under the Game Day tab.</p>
<p><b>Game Day Events:</b></p>
<p><b>UCF Alumni Association Pregame Party:</b> The UCF Alumni Association will host a pregame party at the Fairwinds Alumni Center from 4 to 6 p.m. Saturday. Tickets cost $10 for Alumni Association members and Golden Knights Club members, each of whom can bring one guest at the $10 rate. All other tickets cost $45 each.</p>
<p><b>KnightWalk:</b> Approximately 3:45 p.m.; Between Lots E6 and E7. The team will be dropped at off at the entrance between Gold Zone Lots E6 and E7 near the southeast side of the stadium and will walk through Gate 15 to their home locker room. We encourage fans to line up the entire length of the KnightWalk.</p>
<p><b>Freshmen Frenzy at the Arena:</b> 3:45 p.m., UCF Arena. This exciting pep rally introduces our new students to the wonderful experience of Knights football.
