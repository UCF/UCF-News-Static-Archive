			<p>After an exciting day of alumni and family gatherings, a statue unveiling and a Marching Knights concert, the University of Central Florida's first-ever true home football game nearly concluded with a thrilling upset.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic sell-out crowd watched the UCF Knights fall 35-32 to national powerhouse Texas in the first game at Bright House Networks Stadium. They cheered as the Knights scored the first-ever touchdown in their new stadium and loudly backed the team's comeback from a 13-point deficit to take a fourth-quarter lead.</p>
<p>Before the game, fans gathered for a pre-game ceremony at which UCF President John Hitt and Bright House Networks Central Florida Division President Chris Fenger thanked the many people whose efforts contributed to the construction of the new $54 million stadium.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, UCF Board of Trustees Chair Rick Walsh unveiled a clay-and-bronze statue of a Knight on his horse in front of the Fairwinds Alumni Center. Walsh donated in honor of the UCF Alumni Association. And the Marching Knights band played a concert in the UCF Arena before marching to the stadium for the first time.</p>
<p>Many fans arrived several hours before the game, helping to ensure a smooth flow of traffic onto the campus for what was probably the largest event in the school's 44-year history. Fans brought everything from portable televisions to miniature dogs. Tailgaters of all ages tossed footballs and Frisbees at Memory Mall, where free smoothies and bottles of water were being doled out to hot fans.</p>
<p>Traffic also flowed well from the campus after the game. Physical Plant employees worked hard to keep Memory Mall and other areas of the campus clean throughout the day. On Sunday morning, the campus' lawns were clear of debris and there were few signs that at a football game had been held there the day before.</p>
<p>Throughout the day Saturday, everyone from freshmen to alumni celebrated the exciting atmosphere that could be felt throughout the campus. UCF's guests included Myles Brand, the NCAA president; Charles Millican, the university's founding president; Mark Rosenberg, the chancellor of Florida's State University System; and Rich Crotty, the Orange County mayor.</p>
<p>Tim and Toni Ball, who graduated from UCF in 1988 and 1989 respectively, described the day as &quot;fantastic.&quot; The season-ticket holders were expecting about 20 people to join them for tailgating before the game. Their four children sported UCF T-shirts and cheerleading outfits</p>
<p>&quot;I never thought we'd see this, but we sure are proud to have a stadium on campus,&quot; Tim Ball said as he got ready to fire up the grill.</p>
<p>Matt Fair and his wife, Julie, were rooting for both teams.</p>
<p>Just take a look at the couple's shirts: Half UCF, half University of Texas sewn together. That's because the Fairs' son, John, is a freshman at the Burnett Honors College, and their daughter, Laura, is a senior accounting major at Texas. Both of their children were planning to sit in their respective schools' sections at the game.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it's great for UCF,&quot; Matt Fair said. &quot;Texas has a tremendous football tradition, and it's neat that with the stadium on campus, UCF will start to build those same kinds of traditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Walsh hoped to start new traditions with the unveiling of his statue at the Fairwinds Alumni Center near the stadium.</p>
<p>A 1977 and 1983 alumnus of UCF, Walsh personally commissioned the statute of a Knight on his horse. The artwork is located just outside the alumni center, across the street from the new UCF Arena and in the heart of the north part of campus, which is also home to the stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted something special and a little abstract,&quot; Walsh said of the statute created by Paul George of American Bronze Art Foundry in Sanford. &quot;I wanted something to acknowledge our alumni's achievements and their many contributions toward making a positive difference in their communities. Hopefully, it will encourage others to do the same. It's certainly been a big part of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>UCF has about 160,000 alumni. And while the university is young, Walsh is one of many graduates who have been successful. Well-known alumni also include Al Weiss, president of worldwide operations at Walk Disney Parks and Resorts; Bill Parsons, director of the NASA Shuttle program; Cheryl Hines, an actress nominated for an Emmy for &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm;&quot; and Michelle Akers, a champion women's soccer player.</p>
<p>&quot;We're thrilled that Rick (Walsh) wanted to do this, simply thrilled,&quot; said Tom Messina, associate vice president of Alumni Relations and the Alumni Association.</p>
<p>Ben Munson, Jesse Holler and Brian Kelly, all 20, waved cardboard shields and swords and sported cloth capes as they gathered for the statue unveiling. They posed for fan pictures near the new statue, something that Walsh hopes many more fans will do in the coming weeks and years.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done it justice by dressing up,&quot; said Kelly said about the new stadium. The three students said it took them 48 hours to make their costumes.</p>
<p>Marcel Agredo heeded warnings about potential traffic problems and arrived at UCF at about 5:45 a.m.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you kidding: I wouldn't miss this for the world,&quot; said the third-year student studying Business Administration.</p>
<p>Freshmen were so loud during the Freshman Frenzy at the New UCF Arena that the walls vibrated.</p>
<p>The event was designed to teach students the traditions and songs of the university and to get them excited for the game. A school-wide pep rally broke out, causing an eruption of excitement within the Arena.</p>
<p>&quot;No way am I going into the stadium early,&quot; said SGA President Brandie Hollinger, as she bounced with spirit before the crowd of rowdy freshmen. &quot;I'm going in with the rest of the student body on Sept. 15. Get excited, get pumped Knights!&quot;</p>
<p>UCF men's basketball coach Kirk Speraw and Rukus, UCF's hip-hop dance team, performed along with the Marching Knights band.</p>
<p>Matt Cameron, who expects to graduate in 1999, set up his tailgating camp complete with a satellite dish, inverted generator and television. Joking that he tailgated on Tinker Field next to the Citrus Bowl last year with the more seasoned alumni, Cameron said, &quot;we learned a lot from them.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that it's great to be on campus among all the student fans.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I missed last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A life-size armored knight statue with a cow skull hanging from its hands completed his camp on memory mall. The statue was a popular photo spot for Knights' fans.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had 400 plus pictures taken by 1 o'clock,&quot; he said. Cameron says his camp will be a fixture at every home game, and it will have a new opponent's prop on the knight next week.</p>
<p>Many fans who didn't have tickets and wanted to beat he heat flooded the Student Union where a large screen played ESPN and college football games. Others took shade under awnings around campus and in the new UCF Barnes and Noble bookstore on the north side of campus.</p>
<p>Just before kickoff, four United States Air Force F-15 jets flew over Bright House Networks Stadium as part of the final opening ceremonies. A full house of fans erupted as the team stormed the field in preparation for kick off.</p>
<p>While Texas scored the game's first points with a field goal, Kevin Smith's two-yard run later in the first quarter produced the first-ever touchdown at Bright House Networks Stadium, sending the crowd into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Three hours later, the Knights fell just short of pulling off one of the biggest upsets in college football this season. But many UCF fans still were smiling as they left the campus after one of the greatest days in the history of their university.</p>
