			<p>UCF will be able to recruit and retain more high-quality graduate students by offering them competitive financial support packages, thanks to a Board of Trustees approval on Thursday.</p>
<p>The trustees voted to provide full tuition coverage for all graduate assistants who work at least 20 hours per week, through a combination of setting out-of-state tuition to zero and requiring that their in-state tuition be paid from a variety of sources. In addition, the university plans to provide a health insurance subsidy for graduate assistants and fellows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Existing policies only partially waive tuition and do not provide health insurance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The new policies will make it easier for UCF to compete with other universities for outstanding graduate students. The increased competiveness of UCF&rsquo;s financial officers also will help to enhance graduate programs throughout the university.</p>
<p>Graduate assistants are employed by the university to perform teaching and research duties as part of their professional development. They perform valuable service to the university and contribute to the economic development of the state and community.</p>
<p>The new policy applies to graduate teaching assistants, graduate fellows, graduate research assistants and graduate assistants. About one-fourth of UCF&rsquo;s graduate students serve in those positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other action on Thursday, the Board of Trustees:</p>
<p>-- <b>Approved a six-percent tuition increase </b>for the 2008-09 academic year for all students, and a separate three-percent increase known as differential tuition that will only apply to some new and recently enrolled students. Gov. Charlie Crist&rsquo;s approval is needed for both of the tuition increases, and the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the state&rsquo;s 11 public universities, has yet to approve the differential tuition. With both increases, an undergraduate student who lives in Florida would pay $3,947 for a standard, 30-credit-hour course load next year.</p>
<p>-- <b>Learned that construction of the Burnett Building for Biomedical Sciences</b> at the College of Medicine&rsquo;s Lake Nona campus is proceeding on time and under budget. The building has been topped off, and completion is expected in the spring of 2009.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Foundation excavation is expected to begin on the College of Medicine building in the next few weeks. Students will move into that building in 2010. Both buildings are designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards.</p>
<p>-- <b>Thanked State Senate Majority Leader Dan Webster</b>, R-Winter Garden, for his 28 years of service in the state Legislature. Dan Holsenbeck, UCF&rsquo;s vice president for University Relations, said Webster is the standard by which legislative excellence should be measured.</p>
<p>-- <b>Learned that Vice President and Chief of Staff Beth Barnes</b> will retire in December. A charter member of the UCF faculty, Barnes joined President Hitt&rsquo;s leadership team in 1994. Hitt announced that John &ldquo;Rick&rdquo; Schell, vice provost for Academic Affairs, will be the new chief of staff. In the coming months, Barnes and Schell will work together to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>-- <b>Recognized James Martin</b>, a junior majoring in Physics and a member of the College of Optics and Photonics&rsquo; Research Experience for Undergraduates program. Martin will receive a Congressional Award gold medal in June in Washington, D.C. Congress established The Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement and service of young people ages 14 to 23.</p>
<p>-- <b>Recognized Pegasus Professor winners Eduardo Salas</b> of Psychology and the Institute for Simulation and Training and <b>Mary Lou Sole</b> of the College of Nursing. The awards, presented in April at the Founders&rsquo; Day ceremony, recognize sustained excellence in teaching, research and service by faculty members.</p>
<p>-- <b>Applauded the UCF softball team</b> for winning the Conference USA championship and upsetting the nation&rsquo;s top-ranked team, the University of Florida, during the NCAA regionals last weekend. The Knights finished their season with a program-record 49 wins.</p>
<p>--<b> Welcomed new trustee Logan Berkowitz</b>, president of the Student Government Association. Berkowitz replaces SGA past president Brandie Hollinger.</p>
<p>-- <b>Honored junior Mechanical Engineering major Ashley Ewh</b> for becoming a 2008 Goldwater Scholar. She works in the lab of Yongho Sohn and plans to pursue a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering.</p>
<p>-- <b>Recognized Michael Leuenberger</b>, an assistant professor of theoretical physics in the UCF NanoScience Technology Center, for receiving the prestigious Young Faculty Award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the central research and development organization for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>-- <b>Honored Paul Stokes</b>, a graduate research assistant with the NanoScience Technology Center and the Physics Department, who was selected as one of 60 participants from the United States to attend the 58th meeting of Nobel Prize winners in physics June 29 to July 4 in Germany. He will spend the week listening to lectures and interacting with Nobel Prize winners.</p>
<p>-- <b>Recognized Christopher Estoch</b>, a Burnett Honors College junior majoring in Political Science, for recently receiving a Pickering Undergraduate Foreign Affairs Fellowship for talented students in academic programs relevant to international affairs, political and economic analysis, management, and science policy.</p>
<p>-- <b>Honored eight students who served as legislative scholars this spring</b>. The Political Science and Public Administration students who worked in state legislators&rsquo; offices are: DeOnte Brown, Justin Collins, Jamie Moellentine, Victoria Paterson, Robert Putnam, Raymond Stephens and Jillian Strong.</p>
<p>-- <b>Recognized employees of the month Carmen Afonso</b> (March) and <b>Valda Ramdial</b> (April).</p>
