			<p><span times="" new="">Returning to Florida nearly ten years after he served as the chancellor of the state's public&nbsp;universities, Charles B. Reed urged University of Central Florida graduates Saturday to &quot;never give up.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Reed, now the chancellor of the California State University System,&nbsp;told graduates&nbsp;that was the same advice that then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave during a commencement address&nbsp;50 years ago.&nbsp;While Churchill started his speech by saying &quot;never give up&quot; and then immediately returned to his seat, Reed also offered other advice for the UCF graduates and praised the accomplishments of students who are the first in their families to earn a college degree.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new=""><span times="" new="">
<p>More than 2,700&nbsp;UCF students expected to graduate during three commencement ceremonies Saturday at the UCF Arena. <span times="" new="">The anticipated graduates included 2,138 who filed intents to receive bachelors degrees, 556 for masters degrees, six for education specialist degrees and 67 for doctoral degrees.</span></p>
<p>The summer ceremonies marked the last time that the UCF Arena&nbsp;was used for commencement. Beginning in December, commencement ceremonies will be held at the new UCF Arena, a 10,000-seat facility in front of the existing arena that also will host basketball games, concerts and other entertainment.</p>
</span></span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">This also was the first graduating class for the College of Nursing, which became a college on July 1. The College of Nursing previously was a school that was part of UCFs College of Health and Public Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Reed spoke to graduates of the College of Arts and Humanities, College of Education and College of Sciences. He told the students to thank their friends and families and UCF faculty and staff for&nbsp;helping them succeed in college. He also said students &quot;have an obligation to become givers, not takers&quot; and to give back to their families and the state of Florida.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Reed gave graduates five pieces of advice that he said have never failed him. The first was to &quot;never give up.&quot; Second, he told graduates to continue reading good books. He took a lighter approach with his other pieces of advice </span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">&quot;Check your bag before you leave the drive-through window,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't try to pay off your MasterCard with your Visa. And don't pierce or tattoo anything that you can't hide during a job interview.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Reed also praised the success of UCF in the nine years since he left Florida, citing the many construction projects on campus, the establishment of the College of Medicine and the high quality of academic programs. He praised President John Hitt for those accomplishments and said he is &quot;truly a leader with vision.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">At noon, students from the College of Business Administration and Rosen College of Hospitality Management graduated. They&nbsp;were joined by Liberal Students and Social Science majors through Undergraduate Students and Graduate Studies. </span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Gary Sain, president and chief executive officer of the Orlando/Orange County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, </span><span times="" new="">urged those graduates to develop a personal brand that defines who they are and what they want to achieve. He said they should develop a life plan that covers their goals for the next five to 10 years and find mentors who will keep their best interests in mind. He also said students need to maintain a positive attitude and not listen to those who tell them they cannot do things.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Sain said he stuttered in his youth and could not have imagined that someday he would be giving a commencement address.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">&quot;To grow, you must reach out of your comfort zone and become uncomfortable,&quot; he said. </span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">The final ceremony featured students from the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, College of Health and Public Affairs, College of Nursing and College of Optics and Photonics will cross the stage. </span><span times="" new="">State Rep. Geraldine F. Thompson, the first African-American woman to represent Orange County in </span><span times="" new="">the Florida House of Representatives, told students they should take an &quot;I can&quot; approach to life.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">&quot;Continue to pursue your dreams even when other may not have your vision,&quot; Thompson said.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Thompson was instrumental in raising money to convert the Wells' Built Hotel into the Wells' Built Museum for African-American History in Parramore. She said many people doubted that her vision would succeed when she first proposed it because of the crime and prostitution in Parramore. But the museum &quot;stands today as a reminder of the people who helped to build this community,&quot; Thompson said.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Thompson advised graduates to be willing to take risks and not to forget the friends and family members who helped them get to where they are today. </span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Thompson began her speech by asking students to sit on the edge of their seats, give themselves a round of applause and shout &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; Then she told them that if anyone ever asks them about her commencement speech, they should&nbsp;say that she had the graduates sitting on their edge of their seats, applauding loudly and shouting &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">Following the summer ceremonies, UCF will have awarded about 171,000 degrees since starting classes in 1968.</span></p>
<p><span times="" new="">The three ceremonies held Saturday can also be viewed online at <a href="http://webcast.oir.ucf.edu/">http://webcast.oir.ucf.edu</a>.</span></p>
