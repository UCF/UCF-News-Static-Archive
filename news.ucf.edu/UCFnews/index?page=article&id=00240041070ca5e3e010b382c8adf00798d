			<p>Gov. Jeb Bush signed into law a bill officially establishing the UCF College of Medicine during a ceremony Tuesday outside the UCF College of Optics and Photonics.</p><p>Flanked by Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings, several state legislators and UCF President John Hitt, Bush signed several economic development bills, including the 21st Century Technology, Research, and Scholarship Enhancement Act, which continues the states Centers of Excellence Program. The Florida Photonics Center of Excellence at UCF was established in 2003 with a $10 million grant through the program.</p><p>The Florida Photonics Center of Excellence advances research and graduate education in photonics, optics and lasers and partners with industry, government and economic development organizations to attract and retain photonics companies. The states investment in the center has already generated more than $35 million in federal and private grants and state funds and resulted in 14 patents and 31 new employees at UCF and partner companies.</p><p>Under the bill signed Tuesday, UCF may compete with other universities in the state for part of $30 million appropriated this year for the creation or expansion of centers of excellence.</p><p>This bill also does one extraordinary thing, which is to allow for the expansion of our medical schools to include Florida International University and the University of Central Florida, Bush said before signing the bills. For all those who worked on that, congratulations.</p><p>In March, the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the states 11 public universities, approved creating medical colleges at UCF and Florida International University. The Legislature formalized their authorization during this past session in the bill that Bush signed Tuesday. The law takes effect July 1.</p><p>The Legislature also provided $3 million for life sciences at UCF in the state budget approved last week. The money may be used to begin planning for the UCF medical college.</p><p>Governor, it gives me great pleasure to thank you for the confidence youve placed in us this year in supporting the establishment of colleges of medicine at UCF and FIU, UCF President John Hitt said before introducing Bush on Tuesday.</p><p>Carolyn Roberts, chairwoman of the Florida Board of Governors, and Ray Gilley, president and chief executive officer of the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission, were among the other speakers at the ceremony.</p><p>House Bill 1237, which includes the medical college, also allocates $20 million to create the World Class Scholars Program. The program will help universities offer incentives such as providing laboratories and high-tech equipment to attract leading researchers.</p><p>The other bills that Bush signed Tuesday will, among other things, allow the state to offer cash incentives to companies that want to relocate to Florida, create a sales-tax exemption for machinery that is purchased for research and development, and provide $35 million to upgrade two Kennedy Space Center facilities.</p><p>UCF will soon begin a search for a medical college dean and hopes to have the colleges top administrator in place by fall, Provost Terry Hickey said. The dean would direct hiring of faculty and development of the colleges curriculum and accreditation.</p><p>The degree program calls for a four-year curriculum that will eventually produce about 120 medical graduates each year. It will capitalize on the universitys existing strengths in biomedical sciences, modeling and simulation, and optics and photonics. Other programs in materials science, psychology, chemistry, film and digital media, and nursing also will support the program.</p><p>A joint cooperation agreement between UCF and the Scripps Research Institute will foster collaborative research in some of these areas. UCF and Scripps share many common research interests, including working toward better therapies for cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers.</p><p>UCF also is partnering with the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine to collaborate on research and the curriculum and to provide student and faculty exchanges.</p><p>Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare, two of the largest medical systems in the country, have agreed to establish 95 new medical residencies in cooperation with the medical college. The hospitals also will pay 40 percent of the salaries for 50 full-time clinical faculty members and provide support staff and clinical and office space.</p><p>The College of Medicine and a medical library, along with the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences, will be located at the UCF Healthcare Campus at Lake Nona. The design of the campus will facilitate and encourage instruction and research between the colleges and leave room for expansion as UCFs biomedical programs grow, Hickey said.</p><p>UCF is planning the campus with the developers of Lake Nona, a burgeoning community in south Orlando just east of the Orlando International Airport. The campus site is just south of State Road 417 at a new interchange between Boggy Creek and Narcoosee roads.</p><p>UCF plans to begin construction in January on the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences building as part of the campus first phase, which will include the medical college and library. The biomedical sciences building could be completed by fall 2008, when classes may start.</p><p>The campus will eventually accommodate as many as 5,000 students and faculty who will share up to 2 million square feet of research space and 500,000 square feet of classrooms.</p><p>UCF has raised more than $100 million for construction of the medical and biomedical sciences college and library. That total includes private donations, state matching funds and the value of the Tavistock Groups gift of 50 acres at Lake Nona. Tavistock also led the group of donors with a pledge of $12.5 million.</p>
