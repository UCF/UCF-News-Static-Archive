			<p>The Pegasus Ballroom was transformed into a matrix of cutting-edge research this week with presentations by 104 graduate students and 168 undergraduates. </p><p>The undergraduate winners were announced on Thursday, when Provost Terry Hickey said, I see a roomful of winners; I wish I had awards to give to all. </p><p>Speaking at the closing ceremony, Hickey said he was impressed by the increase in the number of participants. He described it as a testament to our facultys dedication to encouraging their students to engage in research. </p><p>One of the winners, Anthropology major Darcy J. Cope, studied the effects of household corrosive cleaners on human bones and teeth. She wanted to find out how murderers could attempt to hide the identity of their victims. After extensive experiments, her conclusion was that hydrochloric acid did the most damage. As a follow up, Cope said she will probably work on the effects of those cleaners at the DNA level of cells. </p><p>Research Week, sponsored by the Division of Graduate Studies and the Office of Undergraduate Studies, gave the campus community a glimpse into the future of technological, scientific, sociological and artistic studies by students and their faculty mentors. Events during the week included a vendor fair and discussions with top researchers. </p><p>The undergraduate showcase was packed with students, faculty and families of the presenters. One proud mom, Ellen Mohlenhof, was impressed by the great job UCF does to encourage students to learn beyond just books. </p><p>Her son, Eric, displayed a poster presentation on designing artificial neural networks to assist in many biomedical devices. </p><p>Many of the student presenters said they hope to improve their work based on the questions they received from the viewers and judges. Professor Manoj Chopra, a judge in the engineering section, was impressed by the improved level of research work and the high relevancy of the student posters to space and nanoscience initiatives. </p><p>About half of the posters were in the arts, humanities and social science categories. Two viewers  Mechanical Engineering students An Le and Humberto Zuniga -- were appreciative of the mix. </p><p>I liked the highly scientific work being presented alongside the arts, especially the (Flying Horse Editions) prints, Le said. </p><p>President John Hitt greeted the students by expressing his admiration for their hard work and saying that research is becoming more of an integral part of all levels at UCF. </p><p>On Wednesday, graduate students presented their work, and 11 winners were given scholarship awards. The scene was different than at the undergraduate showcase, as a lot more complicated scientific work, especially from the <place w:st="on" /><placetype w:st="on" />College</placetype /> of <placename w:st="on" />Engineering</placename /></place /> and Computer Science, dominated the submissions. </p><p>An eye-catching poster on polar bears was one of the winners. That project involves identifying polar bears by mapping their whiskers, similar to the fingerprinting of humans. The method is being studied by Carlos Anderson a graduate student of biology professor Jane Waterman. </p><p>They studied 50 polar bears in the Hudson Bay area of <state w:st="on" /><place w:st="on" />Alaska</place /></state /> and found that almost all of the bears had individual spot patterns on their whiskers. Polar bears now are tagged for identification, and many times that harms their health and behavior. </p><p>Freshman Sarah Badders, a Biology major, studied the graduate work intently. She said she needed a few more math and science courses before she could grasp the techniques, but she was amazed at the scope of the work presented.</p><p>I did not know so much research was happening at UCF, she said. </p><p>Many of the posters and oral presentations had a lot of relevancy to future commercial applications. Vinu Krishnan and Diwakar Nandiraju, graduate students in Material Science &amp; Engineering, showed the positive effect of introducing iron in the standard alloy of nickel and titanium that is used in many machines that operate at high temperatures. They said NASA could benefit from their study. </p><p>For a list of Graduate Research Forum winners, go to <a href="http://www.graduate.ucf.edu/news/index.cfm?newsID=138">http://www.graduate.ucf.edu/news/index.cfm?newsID=138</a>.</p><p>The following students won awards at the Undergraduate Research Showcase:</p><p><strong>Arts and Humanities:</strong></p><p>First place: Alice F.
