<p>On Oct. 7, 1968, the university&rsquo;s first students, faculty and administrators piled into an unfinished building to begin the first day of classes. It wasn&rsquo;t called the University of Central Florida back then, but Florida Technological University -- the state&rsquo;s seventh public college.</p>
<p>FTU&rsquo;s founding president, Charles Millican, addressed a crowd of more than 2,000 community leaders, local residents, students and professors. Charter faculty members were given special medallions. Students were registered at folding tables. And everyone attended classes in the same building, amidst a scattered construction site that had once been cow pasture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was only roughly one-half of the library building, and they were starting to build the administration building,&rdquo; said Kenneth White, an associate professor in the current College of Business Administration and one of nearly 120 charter faculty members. &ldquo;No one thought it was going to become the sixth-largest school in the country 40 years later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly, the university has experienced tremendous growth since its cow-pasture days. UCF now has internationally recognized programs, high-achieving students and faculty researchers making strides in all areas, from medicine to hospitality to lasers. The university is now among the largest schools in the country. Its original enrollment of about 1,900 students has grown to 50,000 in just four decades.</p>
<p>Since day one, UCF&rsquo;s impact in the community has been be far reaching, affecting the economic, physical and cultural landscape of Central Florida.</p>
<p><b>How it all got started</b><br />
<br />
Everything began when, on June 10, 1963, the Florida Legislature approved the plan to open a university in Central Florida -- an institution that would serve as a knowledge center for the Kennedy Space Center. Frank Adamucci, a New Jersey contractor, made the original land deal, offering to donate half of his land if the other half was purchased. <br />
<br />
Mostly cow pastures, the land was full of rattlesnakes, but the founders didn&rsquo;t see that. They envisioned a better-educated workforce, valuable research and an intellectual and cultural hub for the region.<br />
<br />
Eighty-nine Central Florida citizens joined the initial effort. Drawing on personal funds, they guaranteed a $1 million bank loan to purchase the land, a deal that foreshadowed UCF&rsquo;s later emphasis on partnerships.<br />
<br />
And the university was on its way.<br />
<br />
Charles Millican remembers his first journey to the campus after being selected as the president -- but before any construction had begun. He came, searched and stopped at a store for a packet of peanut-butter crackers. But then he went home when he couldn&rsquo;t locate the site. <br />
<br />
It wasn&rsquo;t until later that he saw the land. As he recalls, it wasn&rsquo;t much at the time.<br />
<br />
Upon taking office, President Millican encouraged everyone on campus to &ldquo;reach for the stars.&rdquo; He set the tone for so much of what the university has accomplished since, and he established the ambitious attitude that still exists today. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Instead of wasting time worrying about a problem, you need to spend time finding solutions to your challenges,&rdquo; Millican said during a recent interview. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pioneering spirit that continues and strengthens, and made a difference in what we are and what we will become.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
During the early years, Millican worked through a lean budget and the changing face of the region, with its shifting needs. The students elected a mascot -- the Knight of Pegasus -- and the university played its first basketball game. U.S. President Richard Nixon gave a speech by the Reflecting Pond in 1973. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;We had a real sense of family when we first started,&rdquo; said Frank Juge, one of the university&rsquo;s original chemistry professors. Juge still teaches today in UCF&rsquo;s Rosen College of Hospitality Management, educating students on the science of wine. &ldquo;I always saw growth. The university has been moving every year.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Charter faculty also remember staying long hours and working closely with one another during those first few years. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;You just were so excited because everything was brand new,&rdquo; said White, one of 10 business professors. &ldquo;The original faculty was about working very hard to make this school known. The early faculty contributed a lot to the reputation of the school. A lot of students wanted to come here because of that reputation.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<b>A new name</b><br />
<br />
The university grew in size and reputation. Its second president, Trevor Colburn, foresaw a school that offered a comprehensive arts and sciences program. And so, another thread of UCF&rsquo;s history began on Dec. 6, 1978, when Florida Technological University officially became the University of Central Florida. <br />
<br />
The new name ushered in a new era and a more expansive identity. Colburn also believed that every outstanding university should have a great athletics department, and under his administration, the varsity football program was launched in 1979. <br />
<br />
UCF also expanded large-scale research efforts, fulfilling the initial vision for the institution. The university opened the Florida Solar Energy Center, the Center for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL), and later the Institute for Simulation and Training in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to campus. <br />
<br />
Research in nearly every academic area has grown since the university&rsquo;s early days, said David Block, the founding director of the Florida Solar Energy Center and a charter faculty member in Engineering. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;The real pillars were the graduate programs,&rdquo; Block said. &ldquo;The graduate programs then led to more research and the huge expansion in the physical resources of the university.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;UCF has benefited from the major growth in the Orlando area, and President Hitt has done a wonderful job of bringing influential people into the university's arms,&rdquo; Block added.<br />
<br />
<b>5 goals for the future</b></p>
<p>The moment he was hired as president in 1992, John Hitt became a student. He studied the university&rsquo;s documents and its history. He spoke with students, faculty and staff. <br />
<br />
Months later, he introduced his five goals to the university and Central Florida community, setting in motion the concepts that were to propel the then-21,000-student body to the 50,000-student university it is today.<br />
<br />
Some say that the university&rsquo;s rise to prominence began when Hitt gave a napkin to UCF&rsquo;s vice president for University Relations, Dan Holsenbeck, in an airport restaurant. On that napkin were UCF&rsquo;s five handwritten goals for the future:<br />
<br />
<i>1. Offer the best undergraduate education available in Florida</i></p>
<p><i>2. Achieve international prominence in key programs of graduate study and research</i></p>
<p><i>3. Provide international focus to our curricula and research programs</i></p>
<p><i>4. Become more inclusive and diverse</i></p>
<p><i>5. Be America&rsquo;s leading partnership university</i><br />
<br />
&ldquo;When he handed me that napkin with those goals, I didn&rsquo;t understand how central they would become to UCF,&rdquo; Holsenbeck said.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even think John knew. It was such a casual moment, so understated, that it&rsquo;s amazing when contrasted with what we&rsquo;ve become. Through those goals, we&rsquo;ve built our university and our neighborhood -- beyond what just about anybody on the outside ever could have imagined.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<b>UCF today</b><br />
<br />
Over the past 40 years, the pace has been intense and the achievements unprecedented. <br />
<br />
The 2007 openings of the 10,000-seat UCF Arena and 45,300-seat Bright House Networks Stadium reflect the university&rsquo;s desire to draw more members of the community to campus while giving students, faculty, staff and alumni a sense of place and pride. UCF last month also celebrated its 40-year partnership with Brevard Community College, now included in its program that guarentees university admission to many community college graduates across the region. <br />
<br />
In so many ways, UCF continues to contribute to Central Florida&rsquo;s economy and well being, impacting more than 25,000 jobs. And the new College of Medicine will add to that growth. <br />
<br />
Its students, faculty and staff also contribute thousands of volunteer hours in local schools and nonprofit groups, striving to improve the Central Florida community through service.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Public higher education stands as one of the true success stories in our nation&rsquo;s history. The public universities stand as a quintessential symbol of who we are and what we stand for as a nation -- opportunity, industry and community,&rdquo; Hitt said.<br />
<br />
UCF now offers more than 220 degree programs. The university has grown to 12 colleges and has conferred more than 180,000 degrees. Its students have won Rhodes, Mellon, Truman and Goldwater scholarships. Alumni lead Fortune 500 companies. UCF and its partners energize the economy and make contributions worldwide.<br />
<br />
