			<p>UCF&rsquo;s next home football game, on Wednesday, Oct. 6, will be the first weeknight game at Bright House Networks Stadium. The game will kick off at 8 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN, providing UCF national exposure.</p>
<p>Weeknight game policies, which have been in effect since the stadium opened, are driven by traffic and parking considerations. The policies allow for the completion of as many classes as possible with a smooth transition to an exciting game day atmosphere in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This advisory outlines the most significant policies affecting students and staff and faculty members. For more details about game days on campus, visit <a href="http://www.UCFGameDay.com">www.UCFGameDay.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty and Staff Appreciation Night</strong></p>
<p>The game will serve as UCF Faculty and Staff Appreciation Night with all faculty and staff eligible to receive a FREE ticket to the game. Visit the stadium's ticket office and show your faculty/staff ID to pick up your ticket, subject to availability. Additional tickets can be purchased for $20. You can also reserve your ticket by calling the Athletics Ticket Office at 407-823-1000.</p>
<p><strong>Class Schedules and Campus Closing Times</strong></p>
<p>On game day, UCF will conduct classes on the Orlando campus and in the adjoining Research Park through 12:20 p.m., allowing for the completion of classes that begin at 11:30 a.m. The Orlando campus and university offices in the Research Park will close for normal operations at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>All employees should consult with their supervisors for details on how this affects them. Some employees, such as those who support game day operations, may need to remain in place after 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>On game day, the Library will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Student Union will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight. The Marketplace will be open from 7:30 a.m. to midnight, and Knightro&rsquo;s will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Classes at the Rosen College of Hospitality Management and UCF&rsquo;s regional campuses will end at 2:50 p.m. on game day, with normal university operations closing at 3 p.m. That will allow for the completion of most classes at those sites and support student and staff and faculty member participation at the football game.</p>
<p>UCF offices will remain closed until 7 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 7.</p>
<p><strong>Main Campus Parking </strong></p>
<p>Staff and faculty members and students who typically park in the C, D and E surface lots or in garages B, C, D and F should park in alternative locations on game day or be prepared to move their vehicles out of those areas no later than 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Vehicles parked in the C, D and E&nbsp;surface lots and in garages C, D and F after 12:30 p.m.&nbsp;must have a valid football Gold Zone parking pass displayed, or they will be subject to towing. Similarly, no parking will be authorized on East Plaza Drive after 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Garage B (level one) will be available for official university business, and specific requests for parking there should be submitted by 5 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 5, to Peter Wallace at <a href="mailto:pwallace@mail.ucf.edu">pwallace@mail.ucf.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Other areas of campus &ndash; including the A and H garages and the B lots &ndash; will be open as usual for student and staff and faculty member parking. Vehicles parked in those lots will be allowed to remain there throughout the day. As on all game days, reserved parking spaces for staff and faculty members will not be honored on game day after 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Student Shuttles</strong></p>
<p>The regular weekday student shuttles that UCF operates&nbsp;on the Orlando campus will&nbsp;follow their usual schedules from 6:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 6.&nbsp; Regular weekday shuttle service to and from the Rosen College of Hospitality Management will conclude at 3 p.m. Regular weekday shuttles to and from the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona will operate on their&nbsp;usual schedules.</p>
<p><a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/student-shuttles.html">Game day student shuttles</a> will operate from 3 p.m. until two hours after the end of the game. Click <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/ucf-shuttle-rosen-college.html">here</a> for information on game day shuttles to and from the Rosen College.</p>
<p><strong>Game Day Parking, Traffic and Tailgating Policies</strong></p>
<p>The campus will open for game day parking and activities at 2 p.m. The open container waiver that allows alcohol consumption will be in effect from 2 p.m. until kickoff.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/goldzone-parking.html">Gold Zone</a>, closest to Bright House Networks Stadium, requires a reserved game day parking permit and is only for members of the Golden Knights Club, credentialed media, stadium operations personnel, patrons with disabilities and students with special permits. The Gold Zone includes surface parking lots C 1-2, D 1-2 and E 1-8, as well as parking garages C, D and F. The first level of Garage D will be available to any vehicle displaying an authorized disabled permit.</p>
<p>Towers residents who have reserved parking spaces in Garages E and G are allowed to remain there on game days.</p>
<p>Almost all parking in the <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/redzone-parking.html">Red Zone</a> and <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/bluezone-parking.html">Blue Zone</a>, except for Garage B, is free and open to everyone on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>UCF operates <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/student-shuttles.html">free shuttles for students</a> to and from several nearby apartment complexes and a <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/tailgating.html">free park-and-ride service</a> for all fans on game days.</p>
<p>Game day traffic patterns will be the same as for a Saturday game, with one exception. On weekdays, many vehicles travel through the campus to get from State Road 408 to the neighborhoods north of UCF. To accommodate that weekday traffic, the university will allow vehicles without game day parking passes to travel through much of the Gold Zone. The exception will be Gemini Boulevard North between North Orion Boulevard and Greek Park Drive.</p>
<p>Glass containers of any type, kegs and beer funnels are not allowed on campus. For more information on tailgating regulations, visit the <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/tailgating.html">UCF Game Day website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Game Day Fan Help Desk</strong></p>
<p>On game day, fans with questions can call 407-882-FANS (3267).</p>
<p><strong>Pregame Festivities</strong></p>
<p>Beginning at 5 p.m., an exciting evening of free and festive activities leading up to the game will take place on IOA Plaza, located near Gates 1 through 4&nbsp;of Bright&nbsp;House Networks Stadium. Several UCF student groups will compete against each other in UCF Athletics' and the UCF Student Government Association's first-annual competitive eating contest. Remove Before Flight will&nbsp;be in concert&nbsp;from 6 to 7 p.m. on IOA Plaza, where they will be performing their fan-favorite, UCF football-themed hit &quot;Knightmare&quot; along with songs from their self-titled studio release.</p>
<p>Between the two events, your UCF Knights football team will be walking straight through the middle of IOA Plaza and into Bright House Networks Stadium at approximately 5:45 p.m. for a special edition of the Knight Walk. Please join the Marching Knights and UCF spirit squad, as ESPN will be taping the team entering the stadium.</p>
