			<p>As Mothers Day approaches, several University of Central Florida professors are available to speak to reporters about the changing role of mothers in society, the corporatization of motherhood, the current challenges many working mothers face, myths about having it all and the moral debate facing society over the appropriate role of mothers.<br />
<br />
Reporters may contact the professors directly. For assistance, call Zenaida Gonzalez Kotala at the News and Information office at 407-823-6120 or zkotala@mail.ucf.edu .<br />
<br />
Terri Fine, an associate professor of Political Science, has published several articles about women and politics, including &quot;The Family and Medical Leave Law: Is it Feminist? Fine says the corporatization of motherhood is to blame for the devaluation of mothers in society. She can provide the historical context for the evolution of a mothers perceived role in society from the homemaker of the 1950s to the super-mom of the 1980s to the have it all approach today. She can also detail the significant developments that empowered women, including the industrial revolution that opened access to new careers and technological milestones such as contraceptive devices, which gave women the power to plan families. 407-823-2081 or tfine@mail.ucf.edu <br />
<br />
Elizabeth Grauerholz, a professor of Sociology, has written and teaches about gender and family issues. She can speak about the fact that, despite more demands today, working moms are spending as much or more time with their children today than their counterparts in the 1970s did. That time is also more qualitative because mothers today are expected to be engaged actively in a childs life, from school projects and volunteering to extra-curricular activities. She can also speak about the deep internal clash mothers face as they try to identify who they are and what they should be doing as their roles keep shifting. Grauerholz laments that women spend too much time justifying their choices and attacking each other about those choices and not enough time working together to address the wage gap and quality day care. She can also speak about her personal experience raising two teenage daughters. 407-823-4241 or grauer@mail.ucf.edu.<br />
<br />
Kimberly Renk, associate professor of Psychology and director of the Understanding Children and Families Lab, specializes in clinical psychology with an emphasis on infant mental health, child psychology and pediatric psychology. She can speak about the stress mothers feel and how that impacts the mother-child relationship. As an expert, she can offer tips for managing the stress created for families. She can also speak about trying to balance it all on a personal level, as she has one young child. 407-823-2218 or krenk@ucf.edu.<br />
<br />
Leslie Sue Lieberman, director of the Womens Research Center at UCF, is a biomedical anthropologist with an emphasis on pediatrics. She has written several articles and conducts research on a variety of issues related to women, including diabetes and communications with minority women. She can speak about having it all, but not doing it all. Lieberman says there are many more choices open to women today, but that discrimination still exists with the wage gap and the glass ceiling. She can also speak about what successful businesswomen have done when planning families and how to transition out of and back into the workforce. She can also address diet and obesity and how they are related to lack of time, stress and sleep that many mothers face. She has a well-adjusted 25-year-old son who she says ate a lot of pizza as a kid as she juggled her career and motherhood.&nbsp; 407-823-5142 or llieberm@mail.ucf.edu<br />
<br />
Annabelle Conroy, an assistant professor of Political Science, was born in Bolivia and taught in the United Kingdom before arriving in the United States. She is a mother of two school-age children. She says she loves her job, but it is sometimes difficult to balance work and her personal life. She said e-mails make professors more accessible so the demands increase. She does much of her work after her children go to bed, and her schedule is flexible enough so she can pick them up from school several days a week. Her husband, another professor, also helps with child care. 407-823-5082 or aconroy@mail.ucf.edu <br />
