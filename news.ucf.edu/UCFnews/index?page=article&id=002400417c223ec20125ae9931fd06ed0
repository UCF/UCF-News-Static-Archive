			<p>Five University of Central Florida professors and Provost and Executive Vice President Terry Hickey were awarded emeritus status Wednesday at the annual Founders&rsquo; Day ceremony.</p>
<p>Faculty and administrators who earn emeritus status have worked at the university for at least five years, and they have retired or are retiring this year. Emeritus status grants them a lifetime link to UCF and honors the major professional contributions and distinction that they achieved in their careers at the university.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Hickey</strong>, Provost and Executive Vice President Emeritus, has played a profound role in the development of UCF over the past seven years while serving as chief academic officer. Hickey&rsquo;s vision for undergraduate education has led to the establishment of one of the largest academic service-learning programs in the nation, as well as an undergraduate research program that is a national model. He established the College of Graduate Studies, enhancing UCF&rsquo;s ability to attract outstanding graduate students. His experience, expertise and energy have been critical to the opening and success of the College of Medicine and &ldquo;medical city&rdquo; at Lake Nona, along with the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy in downtown Orlando.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Armacost</strong>, Associate Professor Emeritus, retired in 2006 after serving as a faculty member in Industrial Engineering and Management Systems for 11 years. He secured more than $2.4 million in funded research. As graduate coordinator, he established two new tracks, led a major revision of the Industrial Engineering doctoral program and strengthened mentoring support for students. He also created an &ldquo;adopt-a-high school&rdquo; program that reached out to potential students.&nbsp; He received the Universitywide Award for Professional Service in 1997, and he served as founding director of the University Analysis and Planning Support Office in 2003. As special assistant to the dean, he also helped to establish the College of Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Duane Davis</strong>, Professor Emeritus, will retire in May after a 32-year career in the UCF Department of Marketing. Currently a professor at UCF&rsquo;s Cocoa campus, he has served as acting director of the Dick Pope Institute of Tourism Studies and as acting chair of the Department of Marketing. Davis' record of scholarship includes a leading market research textbook, 18 refereed journal publications and 35 conference articles. While at UCF, he has taught almost all of the undergraduate and graduate marketing courses and has delivered classes in executive education and continuing education seminars. He also was selected to be a Fulbright Scholar in 1991 in Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>Lucy Morse</strong>, Associate Professor Emerita, has served as a UCF faculty member since 1983 and as director of Engineering Technology at a Distance since 1997. She is known for her work in delivering instruction through distance learning. She established an outreach program for potential engineering graduate students to assist them with returning to school and earning master&rsquo;s degrees. She began a program for Central Florida high school and middle school girls to interest them in careers in science, technology, engineering and math. She has served as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Industrial Engineering and Quality Management Journal. She also is the first woman to receive a doctorate in engineering from UCF</p>
<p><strong>Shiou-San Kuo</strong>, Professor Emeritus, has served as an active UCF faculty member for 28 years. Kuo, a geotechnical engineer, acted as a lead member of a research team that built a circular track for testing expansion joints of highway concrete pavements, the first of its kind in the United States. He directed the Sinkhole Research Institute for 14 years and was instrumental in conducting close to $2 million of sponsored research at UCF. In 1989, he was named the College of Engineering and Computer Science&rsquo;s researcher of the year. A year later, he received the college&rsquo;s Excellence in Advising Award. A dozen graduates who studied under Kuo are now chief engineers or co-owners of engineering consulting firms.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Whisler</strong>, Associate Professor Emeritus, retired in 2001 after a distinguished 30-year academic career at the University of Central Florida. He served as chair of the Department of Music and assistant and associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. As chair, he led the Music Department&rsquo;s effort to receive national accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Music and developed many music history and appreciation courses. After his retirement from teaching, Whisler returned to the university and served as budget coordinator for both Academic Affairs and Regional Campuses. He was interim director of the Nicholson School of Communication in 2008-09.</p>
