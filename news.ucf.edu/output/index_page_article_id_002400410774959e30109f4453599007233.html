			<p>A researcher working to improve the lives of breast cancer survivors and the creator of the Computer Vision lab won the top honors for UCF faculty members Wednesday during the annual Founders Day ceremony.</p><p>Karen Dow of the <place /><placetype />College</placetype /> of <placename />Health</placename /></place /> and Public Affairs and Mubarak Shah of the <place /><placetype />College</placetype /> of <placename />Engineering</placename /></place /> and Computer Science won the Pegasus Professor Awards for 2006. In addition to excelling in their research endeavors, both professors were lauded for mentoring colleagues, working closely with students and for their community service efforts. </p><p><span times="" new="" roman??="">Shah and Dow are the ninth and 10th </span><span>winners of the Pegasus Professor Award, t</span><span>he most prestigious honor the university gives to a faculty member. The award, which was first given out in 2000, recognizes sustained excellence in teaching, research and service.</span></p><p><span></span>Each winner receives a check for $5,000; a statue of Pegasus, the UCF symbol; and a gold medallion engraved with a Pegasus logo and his or her name. </p><p>Dow, who joined the UCF faculty in 1995, was named the first Beat M. and Jill L. Kahli Endowed Chair in Oncology Nursing last year. For five years, Dow has been conducting a study aimed at improving the quality of life for breast cancer survivors. The $1.6 million study is funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research and the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>She also is the lead researcher on a Web-based study about fertility after breast cancer, and she spearheaded the development of WebONE, an online oncology nursing education project that has benefited nursing students at UCF and around the world. </p><p>Her human intervention research has had such positive effect on cancer survivors and their families, College of Health and Public Affairs Dean Belinda McCarthy wrote in her nomination letter for Dow. She possesses remarkable dedication and strong determination to improve the lives of this vulnerable population. </p><p>The Pi Psi Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority supported Dows nomination because she spoke last fall at a luncheon honoring a sorority member who had died of cancer. Dow told the group about her research findings and advised them on how to detect early warning signs of the disease. </p><p>Dr. Dow is an outstanding woman not only because of her accomplishments in research, but because of the type of person she is, sorority members Shanae Hall and Charlyn Stanberry wrote. Dr. Dow is a caring, compassionate and outgoing individual who is always there to lend a helping hand.</p><p>Shah is director of UCFs Computer Vision lab, an initiative he started from scratch nearly two decades ago and turned into one of the top programs in the world. In addition to holding the top research funding record for computer science, bringing in more than $1 million in funding in 2005, Shah has supervised and mentored nearly 30 doctoral, masters and Honors in the Major theses. </p><p>He also started <span>UCFs first Research Experience for Undergraduates program, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which has enrolled 200 undergraduate students from 25 schools since it began in 1987.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Mubarak has very high standards for himself, for his students, for me and other faculty, Issa Batarash, director of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, wrote in supporting Shah for the award. He always strives for excellence.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Last year Shah was named to a new position assisting the vice president for research by extending computer vision applications to multiple disciplines, including </span><span>UCFs ongoing research initiatives in life science, nanoscience and photonics.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Shahs</span> lab has directed projects including the KNIGHT real-time surveillance system for the city of <city /><place />Orlando</place /></city /> police department to detect potential criminal activity in the downtown area. The lab also monitors railroad crossings for potential hazards in a project funded by the Florida Department of Transportation, and it is studying nighttime surveillance for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Automatic Target Recognition for Army Research Office.</p><p>Shah is also working on a project that allows retrieval of video scenes from television broadcasts by text, images and speech. His group has also developed a system for analyzing video acquired by the Unmanned Arial Vehicle. </p><p>But he always finds time for students. Last year two students from <place /><placetype />Lake</placetype /> <placename />Brantley</placename /> <placetype />High School</placetype /></place /> approached him for help with a science fair project in detection of unattended packages at the airports. Working with Shah and his graduate student, the high school students won first prize in the Seminole County Science Fair. </p>
