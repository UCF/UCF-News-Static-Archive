			<p>Diversity and inclusion are key factors for economic change, not only for women and minorities but entire societies. That was the general message of the annual &ldquo;Women and Leadership in the Evolving 21st Century World&rdquo; forum Tuesday at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s program, which focused on &ldquo;breaking barriers,&rdquo; was organized by the UCF Global Perspectives Office in a partnership with retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner.</p>
<p>A panel of four distinguished women discussed an array of issues from poverty to affirmative action. Maria Cristina Santana, an associate professor of journalism and interim director for the Women&rsquo;s Studies Program at UCF, served as moderator.</p>
<p>Retired Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the first woman to achieve the rank of three-star general in the U.S. military, discussed reasons why women live in poverty, what is being done to change their status and how this change will improve national security. She gave examples of various organizations&nbsp;--including Opportunity International&nbsp;-- that are trying to improve the standard of living for women. She described Opportunity International as a microfinance group that strives to improve national security by educating women worldwide and providing a better environment for their children.</p>
<p>Robin Buckelew, director of the Applied Sensors, Guidance and Electronics Directorate at the Aviation and Missile Research and Engineering Center for the United States Army, talked about overcoming gender bias in both her academic and professional careers. Buckelew recalled that when applying to work in the Cooperative Education Program of the U.S. Army, she was rejected because the recruiting authorities said she at some point would &ldquo;get married and quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Rawlinson, editor of the International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics and a professor of philosophy at Stony Brook University in New York, discussed whether or not women have actually broken social barriers. Although women have come a long way in recent history, they still lag behind their male counterparts, she said.</p>
<p>According to Rawlinson, women still earn less than 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. Also, out of the 535 members of the U.S. Congress, only 14 percent are women. Of particular note, women are still more likely to be poorer than men, Rawlinson said. She concluded by asking, &ldquo;To what extent have we broken these barriers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winifred Sharp, a retired judge from the 5th District Court of Appeal, discussed the hurdles she had to overcome in order to become a judge. She was one of six women in a class of more than 200 at the University of Virginia Law School.&nbsp; Despite graduating at the top of her class, she said she was repeatedly denied positions because of her gender, and she soon began to think that the older generation of men that was denying her access was simply &ldquo;hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, Sharp overcame that. She asked the audience to &ldquo;respect those who disagree with you, but don&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a member of the audience asked panel members if they had any words of encouragement about how women might succeed in a male-dominated field, Buckelew said, &ldquo;Humor. Humor humanizes everybody.&rdquo; Rawlinson suggested they take risks and &ldquo;think big. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharp&rsquo;s recommendation was that women &ldquo;always be confident.&rdquo; Kennedy advised that most successful CEOs write down their goals.</p>
<p>When asked what she thought about affirmative action for women, Buckelew replied, &ldquo;Sometimes, when only a few women are admitted, it is because they are incredibly brilliant, regardless of their gender.&rdquo; Sharp said if she were a man, she would not like a woman with the same qualifications getting the job simply because she was a woman. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;we need to encourage a greater number of women to apply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women leaders spoke to a diverse crowd of about 100 and urged listeners to make a difference in empowering women at home and in the workplace.</p>
<p>In addition to the UCF Global Perspectives Office and Lt. Gen. Garner, sponsors of the forum included Lawrence J. Chastang and the Chastang Foundation, the UCF Diplomacy Program, UCF LIFE, the UCF Political Science Department, the UCF Women&rsquo;s Studies Program, the UCF Women&rsquo;s Research Center and the Global Connections Foundation.</p>
