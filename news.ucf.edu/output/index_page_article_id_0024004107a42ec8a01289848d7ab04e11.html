			<p>The UCF Knights will open the 2010 season Saturday, Sept. 4, against the South Dakota Coyotes.&nbsp; The game will kick off at 6 p.m. at Bright House Networks Stadium.</p>
<p>Most of the weekend game day policies and procedures this year will be familiar to fans. The most significant change involves parking lots closest to the stadium opening earlier than they did last season for games starting at 6 p.m. or later.</p>
<p>For the South Dakota game, the Softball Lots (E3 through E5), Lots E6 and E7, the Baseball Lot and Garage F will open for parking and tailgating at 8 a.m. All other campus parking lots will open at noon, the same time they opened for games starting at 6 p.m. or later last season. For all campus tailgating areas, the open container waiver (alcohol consumption) will go into effect at 12 p.m. and end at game start.</p>
<p>Campus parking lots will close two hours after the game, or midnight, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by anyone younger than 21. Anyone consuming alcohol must be prepared to show proof that he or she is 21 or older.</p>
<p>Glass containers of any type, kegs and beer funnels are not allowed on campus.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;more information on&nbsp;tailgating regulations, visit the UCF&nbsp;<a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/tailgating.html">Game Day Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Great Seats Available:</strong> Tickets for the South Dakota game start at $25. Great seats can still be purchased by calling the UCF Athletics Ticket Office at 407-823-1000 or going to <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a>. Students can purchase season tickets or enter a weekly lottery for free tickets to each home game. Visit <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Stadium Opens:</strong> Bright House Networks Stadium gates will open to fans at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Game Day Fan Help Desk:</strong> Fans with questions about game days can call 407-882-FANS (3267) beginning at 8 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Game Day Text Message Help:</strong> Beginning two hours before each game, fans can send a text message to &ldquo;41513&rdquo; and type &ldquo;UCF&rdquo; followed by a brief description of the issue and its location in the stadium. Ushers, public safety or first-aid personnel, or other event staff will respond as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday Classes: </strong>UCF will continue its policy of holding Saturday classes until noon on game days. Afternoon classes will be canceled, and classroom buildings will be locked at 12 p.m. Staff and faculty members with keys may access the buildings after 12 p.m. if they are conducting official business, and they are advised to make sure that doors remain locked after they enter or exit.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to the Stadium:</strong> Traffic patterns before and after games are virtually the same as in 2009. Preferred routes for each of the three parking zones and campus road closures that occur on game days are listed at <a href="http://www.UCFGameday.com">www.UCFGameday.com</a>.</p>
<p>UCF will operate <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/student-shuttles.html">free shuttles for students</a> to and from several nearby apartment complexes, from five hours prior to the start of the game until two hours after the game ends. The on-campus shuttle routes (Black and Gold routes) will not be operating on game days.</p>
<p><strong>Parking and Towing:</strong> Parking policies are virtually the same as they were in 2009. Parking is divided into three zones -- Gold, Red and Blue. The <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/goldzone-parking.html">Gold Zone</a>, closest to Bright House Networks Stadium, requires a reserved game day parking permit and is only for members of the Golden Knights Club, credentialed media, stadium operations personnel, patrons with disabilities and students with special permits.</p>
<p>Anyone parked in the Gold Zone who does not meet the above criteria will be towed as early as 5 a.m. on Saturday. The <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/goldzone-parking.html">Gold Zone</a> includes surface parking lots C 1-2, D 1-2 and E 1-8, as well as parking garages C, D and F. This does not apply to Towers residents who have reserved parking spaces in Garages E and G. They are allowed to remain in their reserved spaces. Parking also is prohibited on East Plaza Drive on game days.</p>
<p>Almost all parking in the <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/redzone-parking.html">Red Zone</a> and <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/bluezone-parking.html">Blue Zone</a> is free and open to everyone on a first-come, first-served basis. Garage B, located across from the Recreation and Wellness Center, is reserved for official university business. Towing will be enforced beginning at&nbsp;5 a.m.&nbsp;in Garage B.</p>
<p>Parking is not allowed along any campus roadways, in residential housing parking lots or garages, or on any open grassy areas throughout campus (except for designated E-lots).</p>
<p><strong>Park and Ride:</strong> Fans are invited to park at off-site parking lots conveniently located in the Research Park. <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/park-n-ride.html">Free UCF Shuttles</a> will continuously transport passengers from the Orlando Tech Center in the Research Park to the on-campus Health &amp; Public Affairs stop at Lot C1. Game day service will be available from 3 p.m. until two hours after game ends.</p>
<p><strong>Fans with Disabilities:</strong> <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/disabled-parking.html">Parking for fans with disabilities</a> is available on the first floor of Garage D across from the UCF Arena. Fans with valid handicapped parking permits are allowed to enter the Gold Zone via Libra Drive or North Orion Boulevard to access Garage D. A free shuttle for patrons with disabilities will be provided from Garage D to Bright House Networks Stadium (Gate 13) from 2 p.m. until two hours after the game ends.&nbsp; Fans with disabilities can park in other handicapped parking spaces on campus, but shuttles will be available only from Garage D.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Policy:</strong> Animals, except for service animals, are not allowed on campus on game days. Anyone who brings an animal that is not a service animal will be asked to take it home. Click <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/animal-policy.html">here</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Protect Yourself From the Heat:</strong> Fans should drink plenty of water or sports drinks, and limit alcohol consumption, to ensure they are replacing essential fluids lost due to the heat. Fans also should consider wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 15 to 30 or higher, a hat and loose-fitting clothes. First-aid stations are located on the main course near gates 10 and 18 inside the stadium, and the American Red Cross will have two aid stations set up on Memory Mall. Click <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/heat-illness.html">here</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Knights Pick Up:</strong> To keep the campus clean, a roving trash and recycling pick-up team called &quot;Knights Pick Up&quot; will travel around Memory Mall every few hours. We encourage fans to embrace the &quot;Knights Pick Up&quot; service and help recycling crews by regularly cleaning up their tailgating areas.</p>
<p><strong>Student Government Activities:</strong> The SGA tailgate area on the south end of Memory Mall will open at noon and will include a DJ, a misting tent open to all fans and free food for students.</p>
<p><strong>UCF Alumni Association Pregame Party:</strong> Fans can &ldquo;chill out and chow down&rdquo; inside the FAIRWINDS Alumni Center from 3 to 5 p.m. Admission is free for fans with UCF Alumni membership cards and their guests. Fans can purchase food and enjoy a DJ, NCAA football games on big projection screens and a game room for kids.&nbsp; Visit <a href="http://www.ucfalumni.com">www.ucfalumni.com</a> for more information.</p>
