			<p>Enticed by extensive research opportunities with faculty and corporate partners, Ruba Amarin left Jordan to pursue her graduate degrees at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>Amarin had studied at the Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT), a prestigious school in Jordan that has sent about a dozen students to UCF. And now UCF students will have the opportunity to travel to Jordan and attend PSUT as part of a new student exchange agreement finalized on Monday.</p>
<p>Princess Sumaya Bint El Hassan and UCF College of Engineering and Computer Science Dean Neal Gallagher finalized the agreement near the end of the princess&rsquo; three-day visit to Orlando. To accommodate UCF students, the Princess Sumaya University for Technology will expand Arab language and culture course offerings and arrange for tours of Jordan&rsquo;s historical sites for UCF students who want to study there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to encourage more of the students who are here at UCF to come to Jordan,&rdquo; Princess Sumaya said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about cultural connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princess Sumaya, 36, chairs the board of the university that bears her name and also heads her country&rsquo;s Royal Scientific Society, a nonprofit institution that is Jordan&rsquo;s largest national applied research institute.</p>
<p>Princess Sumaya said some of her university&rsquo;s students who are studying at UCF &ndash; such as Amarin, 26, and her brother Omar, 22 &ndash; will be &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo; who will help her expand the relationship between the two schools.</p>
<p>The Princess Sumaya University for Technology has been sending students to UCF for about eight years. The relationship started after Issa Batarseh, director of the UCF School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, spent eight months teaching there on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1997.</p>
<p>A native Jordanian, Batarseh later returned for another semester to teach at PSUT, which specializes in electrical and computer engineering, computer science and information and communications technologies. As a result of the student exchange program, more than 10 highly qualified PSUT students have been recruited to attend UCF, Batarseh said.</p>
<p>Ruba Amarin, now a doctoral student, spent a year at UCF as an undergraduate and then returned to obtain her master&rsquo;s degree. She is currently working with Professor Linwood Jones on a research project aimed at improving the sensors on airplanes that fly through hurricanes so they can take measurements from much wider swaths of land, enabling scientists to obtain higher quality data on the storms in little time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the research activities that we lack in Jordan,&rdquo; Amarin said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the resources. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really hard to get a Ph.D. in Jordan. We don&rsquo;t have a lot of companies that would work with the students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a talk that she gave Monday to students and Central Florida residents, Princess Sumaya said one of her goals is to increase research opportunities in Jordan. She said her country first needs to invest more in its own research to open up prospects for more investment from other countries in Jordanian research.</p>
<p>UCF recently licensed technology developed by Batarseh, who is originally from Jordan,&nbsp; to Petra Solar, a company that is working on developing a new method for transitioning power from solar panels into the electrical grid.&nbsp; Petra Solar opened an office in the Central Florida Research Park last fall to work with UCF researchers.</p>
<p>This month, Petra Solar signed a $900,000 research grant agreement with the UCF Florida Power Electronics Center, and the Florida High Tech Corridor Council provided $450,000 in matching funds to support the partnership.</p>
<p>Princess Sumaya said she is striving to integrate entrepreneurship and technology commercialization in Jordan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Walking around this campus gives me a little inkling of hope of where we can get our campus,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She also met in small groups with UCF students, faculty and administrators and with female leaders of the Central Florida Arab-American community during her visit. During one presentation Monday morning, she learned how UCF faculty use technology to enhance students&rsquo; experiences in the classroom.</p>
<p>Ruba Amarin said she enjoyed seeing Princess Sumaya, whom she had gotten to know while attending her university in Jordan. Princess Sumaya&rsquo;s frequent interaction with students there has helped to &ldquo;break the ice between students and royalty,&rdquo; Amarin said.</p>
<p>Ruba and Omar Amarin, who is pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering, said they have found many common bonds between Jordan and the United States. The movie theaters and restaurants are similar, for example, and many children play soccer in both countries. One difference is the United States&rsquo; fervor for American football, and both siblings said they have learned a lot about the game.</p>
<p>Ruba Amarin said she attended all of UCF&rsquo;s home football games this fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big fan now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
