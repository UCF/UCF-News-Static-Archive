			<p>Aspiring to transform the lives of students whose parents did not&nbsp;attend college, the University of Central Florida is raising money for grants awarded through the stateÂ’s First Generation Matching Grant program.</p>
<p>About 7,000 UCF students, or 14 percent of the student population,&nbsp;are first generation. They typically bear most of the burden of college costs, and they face challenges such as not having as much guidance from their parents about college life and how to apply for scholarships.</p>
<p>UCF will accept donations for the First Generation Matching Grant program through Nov. 30. The state will provide $1 of matching funds for every $1 collected by public universities and community colleges.</p>
<p>The state set aside $6.5 million last year for the matching grant program, and UCF awarded grants to 744 students, including Titusville native Debra White.</p>
<p>White, a fourth-year student majoring in Management, works at a local Publix to help pay for her studies. She said the grant money Â“made all the difference for me.Â”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Â“If it werenÂ’t for the first generation grant, I wouldnÂ’t have been able to go to school,Â” she said.</p>
<p>Mark Calabrese, a UCF engineering professor, was the first in his family to go to college and earn a degree.</p>
<p>CalabreseÂ’s mother finished high school and raised her children at home while his father worked as a salesman. It was tough work, and there were few opportunities for education. Calabrese learned early on that getting an education was the ticket to a more comfortable life.</p>
<p>Â“Being a first generation student has been both a privilege and a promise for me,Â” he said. Â“I understand that my education came from the hard work and sacrifice of my parents, who had the same dreams, but didnÂ’t have the same opportunities.Â”</p>
<p>UCF President John Hitt and Board of Trustees Chair Rick Walsh support the initiative because they do not want a lack of money to be an obstacle for students who want a high-quality education and the additional opportunities it provides for them and their families.</p>
<p>Â“When youÂ’re a first generation representative of your family, no matter the adversity, there is great responsibility to honor what it took to get you there,Â” Walsh said&nbsp; Â“It becomes part of who you are Â— to be worthy of the benefits of their sacrifice and make them proud.Â”</p>
<p>Orange City resident Eric Kevari, who earned a bachelorÂ’s degree in Radio/Television Broadcasting in May, said his grant last year was critical to help him finish school.</p>
<p>Â“It was a big deal,Â” said Kevari, who now is a media coordinator for CNH Construction. Â“I didnÂ’t always have to eat Ramen noodles, and it helped me out tremendously with gas and tolls.Â”</p>
<p>Kevari also worked part time detailing cars while he attended UCF, and he received student loans and a Pell Grant to help pay for his education.</p>
<p>Neither of KevariÂ’s parents went to college, but his mother kept encouraging him to go. Now, at age 36, he has a college degree.</p>
<p>Â“I went back because I had lots of friends who encouraged me,Â” he said. Â“I could see where they were going with their degrees. And they really supported me when I needed it with gas and other stuff. I know this was the right thing to do.Â”</p>
<p>Students who apply and qualify for financial aid and whose parents did not&nbsp;earn a bachelor's degree&nbsp;can be eligible for this grant. Recipients must be undergraduates and Florida residents who are not in default of any other school loan programs. Students donÂ’t need to fill out any special paperwork. As long as they have completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which documents the financial need and provides family education information, first generation students will be considered for the money.</p>
