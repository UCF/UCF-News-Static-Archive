			<p>More than 80 volunteers from the University of Central Florida and other organizations are helping Ivey Lane Elementary School students prepare for next weeks Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, which the schools principal is confident will give Ivey Lane its first passing grade in three years.</p><p>First-year principal Ruth L. Baskerville said she began recruiting volunteers early in the school year to help prepare her students for the FCAT, to provide role models for them and to develop the skills and self-confidence they need to succeed in school and in life. </p><p>About 40 Orange County Health Department employees have helped out, along with about 20 UCF students. Other volunteers have come from the <city /><place />Orlando</place /></city /> and <place /><placename />Orange</placename /> <placetype />County</placetype /></place /> governments, Tupperware, Kiwanis International, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and All Saints Church of Winter Park. </p><p>In addition to volunteering for many hours during classes, after school and during Saturday tutoring sessions, UCF and the other organizations have helped Baskerville fill her office and two other rooms with clothing, shoes, toys, games, linens and housewares that students will be able to pick up Saturday, March 4, during the schools first FCAT Mall. </p><p>Students wont need any money to shop; they will turn in currency that they earned for participating in after-school and Saturday sessions of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century program. That program, directed by Kathryn Welsh, includes reading and math tutorials. </p><p>After the FCAT is completed, many of the UCF students and other volunteers plan to continue helping at Ivey Lane, the only <place /><placename />Orange</placename /> <placetype />County</placetype /></place /> elementary school to receive F grades from the state each of the last two years. </p><p>They are making a difference at Ivey Lane, Baskerville said. The students bring a fresh, young, energetic and different approach. Theyre sharing their hearts and their smarts. </p><p>Several UCF students taught by Assistant Professor Terry Thaxton of the English Department tutored Ivey Lane pupils in writing before they took that portion of the FCAT two weeks ago. Those UCF students are now showing Ivey Lane pupils that writing can be fun by working with them on creative writing assignments that also help to teach important writing skills. </p><p>Another group of UCF students, taught by instructor Kathy Hohenleitner of the English Department and Associate Professor of Education Jeff Kaplan, continues to help Ivey Lane students prepare for the math and reading portion of the FCAT. </p><p>The volunteers are accomplishing much more than helping the Ivey Lane pupils improve their math and reading skills. Theyre also becoming role models who can answer questions about college and friends who can talk casually about dolls or sports. </p><p>They get so excited when we go, and its really nice to see how much they appreciate us being there, said Jessica Ryan, a junior creative writing major from <city /><place />Oviedo</place /></city />. They need help, and I dont want them to be another F school again. Its nice to see theyre trying hard. </p><p>Ryan said many of the pupils only associated UCF with football before she and her classmates started tutoring. She has talked with them about what its like to go to classes and live on a college campus and about how they can get scholarships to pay for college. </p><p>Many of Ivey Lanes 400 students are raised by single parents, and almost all of them receive free or reduced-price lunches. </p><p>Ivey Lane fourth-graders will take a field trip to UCF in late March. They will meet with student-athletes, attend a class, tour the library and play games in the Student Union. </p><p>I think that will really open up their eyes, said Ashley Barton, a senior honors student from Port St. Lucie who is tutoring at Ivey Lane. College is just a word for them. Its just something other kids do when they grow up. </p><p>Baskerville sees the FCAT Mall on March 4 as a way to help families with basic needs. Shes encouraging anyone who wants to donate prizes to give sheets, blankets, towels, pillows, rain gear and kitchen items through March 3. </p><p>Donations can be dropped off weekdays from <time hour="8" minute="0" />8 a.m.</time /> to <time hour="18" minute="0" />6 p.m.</time /> and Saturday from <time hour="8" minute="0" />8 a.m.</time /> until about <time hour="15" minute="0" />3 p.m.</time /> at the <place /><placename />Ivey</placename /> <placename />Lane</placename /> <placename />Elementary School</placename /></place /> office, 209 Silverton St., Orlando. For more information on donations, call 407-296-6420, Ext. 2222. </p><p>UCF students and faculty members have donated items to the mall, and several students plan to help set up for the event on March 3 and distribute the prizes on March 4. </p><p><span mso-bidi-language:="" mso-fareast-language:="" mso-ansi-language:="" mso-fareast-font-family:="" times="" ?times="" new="" roman?;="" en-us;="" ar-sa?="">The UCF tutors are enrolled in service-learning classes, <span>which are designed to apply classroom knowledge to projects that will benefit the community.

Donated items can be dropped off between noon and 4 p.m. March 8 at the Education Gym.</p><p>UCF students will deliver the items to Ivey Lane Elementary School on March 9, when they also will give a presentation on values related to Martin Luther King Jr. and enjoy food and games with the pupils.</p>
