			<p>Fourth graders from Ivey Lane Elementary School took a field trip to the University of Central Florida on Saturday, Feb. 17, to raise money for their school and kick off UCFs Leadership Week.</p><p>Twenty-eight fourth graders from Ivey Lane attended and displayed their artwork and writings on the windows of the UCF Bookstore. They performed songs to raise funds for their school later sat in a College of Engineering and Computer Science classroom. Each Ivey Lane student was paired with a UCF student or volunteer for some personal interaction to complete the experience. </p><p>More than 75 UCF students volunteered by mentoring fourth graders for the day or helping at booths for face painting, smoothies and other fun activities. Knightro and the UCF cheerleaders mingled and posed for pictures with the fourth graders, and Miss UCF Denesha Jenkins sang Happy Birthday to pupils who had celebrated birthdays recently.</p><p>The impact of the event, now in its second year, has been profound, said Ruth Baskerville, the second-year principal of Ivey Lane.</p><p>These kids had no goals at all going into this event last year. They thought UCF was just a football team, Baskerville said. They were astounded when they saw the magnitude of college and started to believe that one day they could be there.</p><p>Terry Thaxton, an assistant professor of English who also is director of UCFs Literary Arts Partnership with Ivey Lane, encouraged the students to think about attending UCF in the future. She plans to organize college information sessions for parents at Ivey Lane.</p><p>Baskerville reports that, when asked a year ago, 100 percent of the Ivey Lane fourth graders believed they were too poor to go to college. She estimates that this year that number is down to about 25 percent and continues to fall. The field trip is designed to show the kids what it is like at UCF and also to encourage them to believe that going to college is a realistic goal for them.</p><p>Ivey Lane, a school in a lower-income area of Orlando, was the only school in Orange County to receive an F grade in both 2004 and 2005. But with the assistance of UCF volunteers, as well as volunteers from Tupperware, Kiwanis International and other local organizations, that grade was raised to a C in the 2005-2006 school year.</p><p>If I had a scale, I couldnt measure the amount of help that UCF has given to make that possible, Baskerville said. I believe the kids have turned the corner to wanting to get out of their position. </p><p>UCF has been working with Ivey Lane for more than a year to boost not only Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test scores but also the confidence and attitudes of their students. </p><p>The UCF Literary Arts Partnership provides creative writing classes for both fourth-grade classes at Ivey Lane every Tuesday with the assistance of five UCF students. The UCF students also provide one-on-one tutoring for about 30 Ivey Lane students.</p><p>The children love adults coming to their classroom who will listen to them -- adults who view education and learning as important enough to take time to work with them, Thaxton said.</p><p>The impact the program has on the Ivey Lane students stretches beyond just the classroom.</p><p>Not only are the students from UCF helping fill the absence of vocabulary that our kids have by expanding the words they use in their writing, but they are lifting their attitude and disposition and they are teaching them patience, Baskerville said.</p><p>The effect of the Ivey Lane tutoring reaches the UCF volunteers who give their time and effort each week as well.</p><p>UCF students experience a new world with the children. They see their own privilege -- their privilege of education, Thaxton said.</p><p>According to Thaxton, many UCF students showed interest in helping at Ivey Lane, and the Literary Arts Partnership is looking to expand their work to other inner-city schools, especially the middle schools and high schools that Ivey Lane feeds into. The program is also working with Baskerville trying to set up a college information session for the parents of the Ivey Lane students.</p><p>Were shaping the lives of the kids in this community, Baskerville said, but we cant do it alone.</p>
