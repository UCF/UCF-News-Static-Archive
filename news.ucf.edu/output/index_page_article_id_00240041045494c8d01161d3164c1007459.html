<p>There are about 12,000 parking spots available on campus. Parking is divided into three sections -- Gold, Red and Blue.</p>
<p>The Gold Zone, closest to Bright House Networks Stadium, requires a reserved game day parking permit and is only for members of the Golden Knights Club, credentialed media, stadium operations personnel, patrons with disabilities and students with special permits.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Only Gold Zone patrons and those with disabilities will be allowed to drive on and off campus via Orion Boulevard from three hours prior to kickoff until two hours after the game ends.</p>
<p>Almost all parking in the Red Zone and Blue Zone is open to everyone. The spaces are free and on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Parking is not allowed along campus roadways, in residential housing parking lots or garages, or on any open grassy areas throughout campus.</p>
<p><strong>Parking for fans with disabilities:</strong> Parking for fans with disabilities is available on the first floor of Garage D across from the UCF Arena. Fans with valid handicapped parking permits are allowed to enter the Gold Zone via Libra Drive or Orion Boulevard to access Garage D. While there are other handicapped parking spaces throughout the campus, shuttles to and from the stadium will be available only from Garage D.</p>

<p>Students who live in the Towers residence halls will not be able to access parking garages E and G between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Saturday. They can leave their vehicles in the garages during that time or move them to another location outside of the Gold Zone before 9 a.m.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Classes: </strong>UCF will follow the same policy that has been in effect throughout the season. Classes that begin before noon on Saturday will be held. All of those classes will be held in the Communications Building. While other academic buildings on campus will be locked on game day, professors and students who want to work in their offices or research labs will be able to do that if they have keys to get into the buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Knightwalk:</strong> The UCF football team is expected to arrive around 9:30 a.m. Saturday at IOA Plaza on the west side of the stadium (by gates 2 and 3). The Marching Knights and cheerleaders will join the team for the Knightwalk through the plaza and into the stadium.</p>

Tickets are $10 each for Alumni Association members and Golden Knights Club donors and for one guest per member. Tickets are $45 for all additional non-members.</p>

<p><strong>No glass:</strong> Fans are reminded that glass is not allowed in the tailgating areas on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Neighbors:</strong> Fans should be respectful of UCF&rsquo;s neighbors and are advised to park on campus for free and not park in surrounding neighborhoods. Law-enforcement officers will be patrolling local subdivisions on game day to encourage fans not to block driveways or park on private property.</p>
<p>Orange and Seminole counties' ordinances prohibit open containers of alcohol on public streets or parking lots. For a more detailed news story on UCF working with neighbors, click <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=002400412e120743011469b630a70078b7">here</a>.</p>

Fans are encouraged to show respect to UCF's guests from Tulsa. For more information, click <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=002400412e120743011469b630a7007770">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gemini Boulevard North will be closed to vehicle traffic from Alafaya Trail to North Orion Boulevard from three hours prior to game time until two hours after the game ends. This road closure is designed to ensure pedestrian safety between the main and north sections of campus.</p>
<p>UCF will operate about 25 shuttle buses for students to and from several nearby apartment complexes, from five hours prior to the start of the game until three hours after the game ends. The service is free. The on-campus shuttle routes (Black and Gold routes) will not be operating on game days.</p>
