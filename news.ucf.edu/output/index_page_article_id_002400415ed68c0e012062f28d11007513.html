			<p>In today&rsquo;s economic tempest, it is vital to find ways to keep our financial ships afloat. The Central Florida Global Forum 2009, on Thursday, April 9, offered a stage for business leaders to share innovative suggestions on how to do that and, more importantly, how to navigate to calmer waters.</p>
<p>Sibille Pritchard, president of the Global Connections Foundation, a co-sponsor of the event, explained that the aim of the forum was &ldquo;to give a realistic perspective of Central Florida&rsquo;s role in the global economy.&rdquo; Nearly 200 people attended the forum</p>
<p>The opening presentation was given by Ray Gilley, CEO of the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission. He said the enormous impact the economic downturn has had on so many people is what is making this environment so turbulent. However, Gilley said he believes that there is a brighter viewpoint that one can take on this situation: &ldquo;The good part is that it is a tremendous opportunity for those in transition to decide where you really want to go in life.&rdquo; Furthermore, this upheaval has also spurred companies to strive to become more effective and to synergize with other companies. Gilley concluded his introduction by saying, &ldquo;We have mountains and valleys of economic prosperity here&hellip; and we stand to gain through creativity and innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subsequent panel included four business leaders who spoke about both domestic and international perspectives. It featured Cesar Calvet, president of the Latin Banking Group, CNLBank; Lawrence J. Chastang, principal of LarsonAllen LLP; J. Brock McClane, director of McClane Tessitore; and Vinod Philip, director of Gas and Turbine Engineering for Siemens Energy Inc.</p>
<p>Calvet explained that &ldquo;we are concerned that lending will shrink because not only is it how banks make money, but it also drives a lot [in the economy].&quot; However, these turbulent times might not be so negative for all players. CNLBank grew its deposit base by 88 percent in 2008. Calvet partly attributed that growth to the increase in direct international flights to Orlando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orlando has become an alternative to Miami&hellip; and it has become that much easier for international clients to come and invest their money here.&rdquo; Calvet said, adding that Venezuela and Brazil rank first and second among the largest international deposit bases in Orlando.</p>
<p>Chastang explained that businesses &ldquo;need to be able to react to what part of the world is hot&rdquo; and not put all of the emphasis on one seemingly successful area that could at any time falter. One of his key messages to the audience was that &ldquo;old rules still apply and will always apply.&rdquo; He cited the downfall of Bernard Madoff&rsquo;s Ponzi scheme and those too-good-to-be-true investments as an example of this concept. Chastang also established his belief that America is and will continue to be a top player in the global economy, citing the oft-stated phrase when America sneezes, much of the world catches a cold and developing countries get pneumonia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McClane spoke of the effects of these turbulent times on the legal profession. He explained that two years ago, some of the most prevalent jobs for lawyers consisted of mergers and acquisitions and corporate real estate.&nbsp; He noted that, in today&rsquo;s economy, mergers and acquisition work is practically nonexistent, while foreclosures and mortgages are in high demand. He also pointed out that another area that rapidly grew in the litigation arena was fraud. He also explained that &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in is entrepreneurship,&rdquo; as employee and capital costs are down and new talent is available.</p>
<p>Philip presented Siemens Energy Inc.&rsquo;s strategy during the last few years as an example of how businesses can handle such economic environments.&nbsp; He explained that beginning four years ago, Siemens started to focus on four megatrends: urbanization, demographic change, climate change, and globalization. By doing so, the company reduced its dependence on the market and strengthened itself by forecasting major future needs. Philip concluded by emphasizing the need for strategic alliances, retaining the best employees, and a customer service focus. He explained that &ldquo;ultimately when things get tough, you should focus on customers and make them successful&rdquo; because customers are what will determine a company&rsquo;s success at any point in the economic cycle.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker, global strategist Phoebe Eng, presented a lecture on &ldquo;Fluency: The Art of Crossing Borders&rdquo; with an emphasis on Central Florida. With more than 20 years of experience in consulting with organizations on how to spur innovation through globalism and diversity, Eng made her case by revealing how deep these concepts are already ingrained in our society. She argued that &ldquo;hyper-diversity and the disappearance of borders&rdquo; of all types are key to creating the best opportunities. One example she gave included a reference to the existing four &ldquo;majority minority&rdquo; states of Hawaii, New Mexico, California, and Texas. These states are comprised of a population in which the majority is composed of ethnic and racial minorities.</p>
<p>Eng advised business people to &ldquo;stop being so Western.&rdquo; She explained this concept by comparing the process of making a business deal in the United Sates to one in China, where &ldquo;gu¿nxi&rdquo; -- or relationships -- are at the core of business deals. She argued that instead of being so goal-oriented, the first question to the potential partner should be &ldquo;how are you related to me?&rdquo; Second, Eng suggested that people should &ldquo;view borders differently.&rdquo; Instead of seeing borders as points of separation, she advises people to see them as points of intersection, where cooperation can exist.</p>
<p>Eng also suggested that the global society needs to incorporate a &ldquo;blended bottom line,&rdquo; which includes both financial profits and societal benefits. Socially responsible businesses are already starting to do so. Eng said that Orlando, with its competitive advantage in the health care and technology industries and as a center of entrepreneurial activity, needs to expand these advantages and make them sustainable by heightening its society&rsquo;s &ldquo;fluency&rdquo; in all areas. Eng concluded her presentation by stressing that Orlando should then share its success stories with the world and become a model for other cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Global Forum was sponsored by UCF Global Perspectives Office, Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission and the Global Connections Foundation, in partnership with the UCF College of Business Administration, Lawrence J. Chastang and the Chastang Foundation, C.T. Hsu and Associates, OCI Associates Inc., The Anil and Chitra Deshpande Foundation, LarsonAllen LLP, Junior Achievement of Central Florida, Inc., the UCF Political Science Department and UCF LIFE.</p>
