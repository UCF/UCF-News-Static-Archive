			<p>Fourteen University of Central Florida professors were awarded emeritus status Wednesday at the annual Founders&rsquo; Day ceremony.</p>
<p>Faculty and administrators who earn emeritus status have worked at the university for at least five years, and they have retired or are retiring this year. Emeritus status grants them a lifetime link to UCF and honors the major professional contributions and distinction that they achieved in their careers at the university.</p>
<p><strong>William Bozeman</strong>, Professor Emeritus, has served a 26-year career as a UCF faculty member and a department chair in the UCF College of Education, where he has distinguished himself nationally as a leader in the field of educational leadership. His expertise in program design and coordination helped develop a doctoral program in educational leadership. Bozeman also led and secured funds for the Danforth Program and the Progress Energy Leadership Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Kristin G. Congdon</strong>, Professor Emerita, will retire in May after a 23-year career in the UCF Department of Philosophy. She has worked with numerous students and mentored many even after graduation. She also has mentored faculty members, particularly women, in their research and in the tenure process. A champion of the arts and humanities, Congdon has fostered interdisciplinary conversation within and outside of UCF. She serves as a longstanding resource for the Florida Humanities Council. Her achievements brought her national and international recognition for which she was awarded the UCF Presidential Award for Special Merit.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald D. Dutton</strong>, Professor Emeritus, recently retired after a 39-year career at UCF. He joined the university as an assistant professor of Computer Science and later became a professor, director and chair of the Department of Computer Science. He established the Computer Science Programming Team in 1986 and continues to be actively involved. Dutton published a large number of papers in international journals and conferences. He remains active in research with a journal paper recently accepted for publication and another one in review, and he continues to supervise a doctoral student.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Frederick</strong>, Professor Emeritus, will retire in August after a 36-year career at UCF. Now an associate dean in the College of Arts and Humanities, he founded the UCF Department of Computer Science and served as its first chair. He designed the Computer Science curriculum, developed the first doctoral program at UCF and the state&rsquo;s first doctoral program in Computer Science. Frederick also established the first departmental level e-mail system and recruited the first National Merit Finalist to UCF. He secured more than $4.5 million in funding, and his efforts led to the development of the nationally acclaimed UCF Computer Science Programming Team and the naming of the UCF Computer Science Program as a state &ldquo;Center of Excellence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Richard Gilson</strong>, Professor Emeritus, has been with UCF for 25 years in the Department of Psychology and is a top scholar in Human Factors Psychology. He has published widely and secured more than $900,000 in funding. Gilson supervised more than 20 dissertations and regularly taught some of the largest undergraduate classes.
