			<p>Former U.S. Ambassador Peter W. Galbraith discussed the war in Iraq and its impact on the United States during a Monday visit to the University of Central Florida that included a public presentation, a guest appearance on a UCF TV program and community meetings.</p>
<p>Galbraith, now a senior fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, gave a presentation titled &ldquo;The Future of Kurdistan and Iraq&rdquo; to an audience of more than 100 at the Fairwinds Alumni Center.&nbsp; The event served as the UCF Global Perspectives Office&rsquo;s annual Iraq War Forum, held each year since the war in Iraq began in 2003.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the purpose of the war in Iraq?&rdquo; Galbraith asked. There are many reasons given, he explained: to make the United States stronger and more secure by removing the &ldquo;worst regime in the region, with the worst weapons&rdquo; and to show American strength and leadership. Another goal was to bring democracy to Iraq and have a &ldquo;domino effect&rdquo; throughout the Middle East by eventually replacing the monarchy in Saudi Arabia, pressuring for political reforms in Egypt, diminishing the power and influence of Iran in the region and intimidating other rogue states such as North Korea.</p>
<p>Next, Galbraith asked, in terms of all of these goals, &ldquo;Where do we stand?&rdquo; As far as bolstering U.S. strength and security, Galbraith asserted, &ldquo;we have clearly failed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cited Iran&rsquo;s continued pursuit of nuclear technology and North Korea&rsquo;s departure from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and continued defiance (North Korea now possesses at least six nuclear weapons) as examples of this failure by the Bush administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Galbraith also explained that the United States has failed in showing strength and leadership.&nbsp; As he put it, &ldquo;American prestige and standing in the world, at least at the end of 2008, had never been lower.&rdquo; Galbraith uses Turkey as a prime example. Whereas many Turks once showed great support for the United States, specifically because of U.S. efforts in Kosovo, Bosnia and Albania, from where many Turks trace their heritage, a Pew Charitable Trust poll in 2007 found that 83 percent of Turks had an unfavorable view of the United States.&nbsp; Galbraith asserts this is primarily because of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>In regards to spreading democracy, Galbraith contended that &ldquo;authoritarian regimes in the Middle East are now stronger.&rdquo;&nbsp; For example, Iran was previously led by the moderate Mohammad Khatami.&nbsp; However, in 2005, hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president, and Iran has continued to be a thorn for the United States in the region. In Syria, the &ldquo;Baathists were once crumbling,&rdquo; Galbraith explained, but they are now much stronger.</p>
<p>Galbraith said that if things go badly in Iraq, the Obama administration will take the blame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a very good chance we are not winning right now (in Iraq,)&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Tension among Iraq&rsquo;s ethnic groups &ndash;the Kurds in the North, the Sunnis and the Shiites &ndash; is perhaps the biggest obstacle to overcome. There isn&rsquo;t a sense among the peoples of Iraq of a shared identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history of Iraq is one of &ldquo;brutal oppression&rdquo; in order to keep the Shiites out of power and to prevent the Kurds from declaring independence and leaving Iraq.&nbsp; Galbraith explained that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki does not have support from the Kurds or the Sunnis based on recent election results, but continues to exercise his power. Disputes over territory in Northern Iraq between the Kurds and Arab groups could also result in conflict.</p>
<p>When asked by an audience member whether or not the plan to divide Iraq into three separate federal states, or even independent countries, was still being discussed in Washington, Galbraith responded that such a question needs to be addressed by Iraqis.&nbsp; Furthermore, Galbraith said the United States should not be in the business of trying to figure out how to piece Iraq back together.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, Galbraith was a professor of national security strategy at the National War College. He has held senior positions in the United States government and with the United Nations. From 1979 to 1993, Galbraith was a senior advisor on Near East and South Asia and international organizations to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>From 1993 to 1998, he served as U.S. ambassador to Croatia, where he was actively involved in the Croatia and Bosnia peace processes. In 1995, he helped mediate the Erdut Agreement that ended the war in Croatia by providing for peaceful reintegration of Serb-held Eastern Slavonia into Croatia. From 2000 to 2001, Galbraith was director for Political, Constitutional, and Electoral Affairs at the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor. He also served as a cabinet member for Political Affairs and the Timor Sea in the First Transitional Government of East Timor.</p>
<p>Galbraith has authored many books, including &ldquo;The End of Iraq&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unintended Consequences: How War in Iraq Strengthened America's Enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The forum was sponsored by the UCF Global Perspectives Office, Lawrence J. Chastang and the Chastang Foundation, UCF Student Government Association, UCF Political Science Department, UCF Middle Eastern Studies Program, UCF Kurdish Political Studies Initiative, UCF Diplomacy Program, UCF LIFE and the Global Connections Foundation.</p>
