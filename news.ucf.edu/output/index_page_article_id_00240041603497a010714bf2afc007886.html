			<p><span>The leader of the soon-to-be-established Afghan Counterterrorism Centre in <city w:st="on" />Kabul</city /> said Thursday that while the <place w:st="on" /><country-region w:st="on" />U.S.</country-region /></place /> invasion has led to the adoption of an enlightened constitution and the return of many children to school, it also has sparked a booming drug economy that has given terrorists new life.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Hekmat Karzai, now an RMS Fellow at the <placetype w:st="on" />Institute</placetype /> of <placename w:st="on" />Defence</placename /> and Strategic Studies in <country-region w:st="on" />Singapore</country-region />, spoke at a <place w:st="on" /><placetype w:st="on" />University</placetype /> of <placename w:st="on" />Central Florida</placename /></place /> forum on The Evolving Terrorist Threat. The forum concluded a three-day working conference on terrorism sponsored in part by the UCF Global Perspectives Office.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Brian Michael Jenkins, senior advisor to the president of the RAND Corporation, and Edward J. Salazar, acting deputy coordinator for programs in the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the U.S. Department of State, also spoke during the forum. Stephen Sloan, a UCF professor who has studied terrorism and conducted simulations and workshops on the subject for four decades, served as the moderator.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Karzai said terrorist groups have become more adaptable, patient and resilient as a result of a war that has led to the killing or capture of about three-fourths of Al Qaedas top leaders and the destruction of terrorist camps in <place w:st="on" /><country-region w:st="on" />Afghanistan</country-region /></place />. </span></p><p><span></span><span>At one time, we faced one Al Qaeda, Karzai said. Now Im certain that were facing 20 to 30 Al Qaedas.&quot;</span></p><p><span></span><span>The additional threats come from local groups that developed more radical agendas and a more global ideology as they trained in <place w:st="on" /><country-region w:st="on" />Afghanistan</country-region /></place /> under Al Qaeda leaders before 2001, Karzai said. Followers who were inspired by Al Qaedas beliefs but who are not affiliated with any groups also have become an increasing threat.</span></p><p><span></span><span>&quot;There has never been a military solution to terrorism, insurgency or guerilla warfare, Karzai said. &quot;In dealing with these kinds of warfare, we have to use political, social and economic messages.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Jenkins, one of the worlds leading authorities on terrorism, discussed how its so much more difficult to judge progress in the war on terror compared to World War II. The lack of a clear way to measure progress can be frustrating to Americans who have a short-term outlook on the war on terror and expect relatively quick victories.</span></p><p><span></span><span>In contrast, those fighting the war view it as an eternal struggle, Jenkins said. They believe their superior moral commitments can defeat Western nations superior militaries, and they also believe that fighting that war is a religious obligation.</span></p><p><span></span><span>While the <place w:st="on" /><country-region w:st="on" />U.S.</country-region /></place /> response to the Sept. 11 attacks forced terrorist groups to operate less in the open and disrupted money transfers, terrorists have succeeded in several attacks  about one every two months  since the Sept. 11 attacks, Jenkins said. That includes high-profile attacks in Bali, <city w:st="on" />Istanbul</city />, <state w:st="on" />Madrid</state /> and <place w:st="on" /><city w:st="on" />London.</span></p><p></city /></place /><span>&quot;Weve failed to address the political aspect of this, Jenkins said. We really have not interrupted the recruiting process.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Jenkins served as an advisor to the federal government and private sector on terrorism. In 1996, he was appointed by President Clinton to be a member of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. He was an advisor to the National Commission on Terrorism in 1999 and 2000.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Addressing the situation in <country-region w:st="on" />Iraq</country-region />, Jenkins said that even if the <place w:st="on" /><country-region w:st="on" />United States</country-region /></place /> and its allies succeed in setting up a sophisticated, high-level government, that may not stop the high level of political violence. He cited <country-region w:st="on" />Colombia</country-region /> and <place w:st="on" /><country-region w:st="on" />Sri Lanka</country-region /></place /> as examples of nations with sophisticated governments and a lot of political violence.</span></p><p><span></span><span>At the State Departments Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Salazar coordinates programs related to terrorist finance, travel interdiction, technical cooperation, and international anti-terrorism and law enforcement assistance. He also manages the State Department's counterterrorism public diplomacy efforts.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Salazar said its not easy to develop a new policies to deal with a new kind of enemy and a new kind of war when terrorism wasnt taken seriously by our society before Sept. 11.</span></p><p><span></span><span>In our minds, terrorism was something that took place somewhere else, he said. We werent concerned it was going to hit us here at home.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Salazar said its important to cut links between terrorist groups to make it more difficult for them to operate. He said strategies need to deal with terrorist group leaders, safe havens and their root conditions. Safe havens include areas near borders of Arab countries that are often not governed or loosely governed, he said. The Internet also has become a safe haven for terrorists, he said. </span></p><p><span></span><span>The forums other primary sponsors included the Centre for Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews in <country-region w:st="on" /><place w:st="on" />Scotland</place /></country-region /> and the Institute for Transitional Democracy and International Security in <place w:st="on" /><city w:st="on" />Budapest</city />, <country-region w:st="on" />Hungary</country-region /></place />. </span></p><p><span></span>The forum was part of the Connecting the UCF Community series, which promotes academic and civic engagement and is designed to create meaningful dialogues among students, faculty and the community. UCF sponsors were the Office of Undergraduate Studies, the Political Science Department, the Department of Criminal Justice and Legal Studies and the Middle Eastern Studies Program. The Orlando Sentinel and Global Connections Foundation also sponsored the event. </p>
