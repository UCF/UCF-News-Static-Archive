			<p>Patty Walker is starting her second year as a classroom teacher this month thanks to a unique program offered at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Walker gets her classroom at BellaLago Academy in Kissimmee ready for students, she marvels at how much her life has changed. She was a teachers assistant for nine years at Reedy Creek Elementary School before taking the plunge and getting certified as a teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CORE program at UCF allowed me to fulfill a dream, she said. It allowed me to be a full-time mom and wife, keep my job and be a full-time student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She and the 10 other paraprofessionals who graduated from the Creating Opportunities and Resources for Educators (CORE) program in the College of Education at UCF last summer are getting their classrooms ready for the fall. And its exactly what designers of the program wanted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that there are approximately 30,000 new teachers needed for Florida public schools this year, keeping teachers is as important as recruiting and hiring them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our research shows that 99 percent of paraprofessionals who become teachers stay, said Jennifer Platt, executive associate dean for academic affairs in the College of Education at UCF. While we produced a relatively small number of graduates in this first class of paraprofessionals, they are staying in teaching. Thats very important, because we know that within three to five years, many new teachers leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UCF College of Education, Valencia Community College/Osceola Campus and the School District of Osceola County created CORE in 2000. The goal: to provide paraprofessionals the tools they need to become full-time teachers. Given that most paraprofessionals  everyone from teaching assistants to bus drivers  stay with their schools for years, creators believed they would stay on as teachers as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have a vested interest, Platt said. Many of them have children in the schools in Osceola County. And since the partnership has provided financial incentives, candidates can continue to work and go to school to get the training they need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats one of the reasons Walker enrolled in the program. When she heard the CORE program took care of tuition and that she would be able to keep her job and stay in Osceola County, she jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School District of Osceola County, the Foundation of Osceola Education, Inc. and the Boeing Co. provide funding for tuition and scholarships throughout the program. UCF and Valencia Community College work with the candidates to create flexible schedules of classes that allow students to keep their paraprofessional positions back at their schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the community college they take prerequisites such as math and English. UCF professors travel to Valencias Osceola campus to offer all of the classes they need for teaching, everything from teaching methods to classroom management. Students also get help registering for classes, one-on-one mentors, a laptop to use throughout their education and tutoring if needed. Once they graduate, they must work three years in the district and are assigned mentors at their schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They took the scare factor out, Walker said. I dont think I would have done it if it werent for the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By all accounts, the teachers appear to be succeeding. Four of the graduates earned the Salle Mae First Year Teacher Awards for Excellence at their schools. Some were invited to help write or revamp curricula in the district.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others informally offer guidance. Walker, for example, regularly talks to BellaLagos computer specialist Ruth Douvres, who is now in the CORE program. Another 25 to 30 students, including those studying to become special education teachers, are enrolled. The second graduating class is scheduled for commencement in December.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walker said she believes the program could be the answer to the teaching shortage in Florida and beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, its small scale here, but there is a huge untapped resource in schools across the country . . . paraprofessionals, she said. If school districts, colleges and universities could work out partnerships, you could easily draw these folks into the profession and they would never want to leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walker plans on teaching until she retires. Her pay increased three times when she made the move, which helped pay for her sons college tuition and now her daughters tuition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UCF College of Education awards the most education baccalaureate degrees in the state. Last year, more than 1,000 students earned degrees there. Platt said the College of Education is constantly looking for ways to partner with local school districts to help solve the teaching shortage by creating opportunities to give candidates the knowledge and preparation they need to be effective teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wed be willing to work with any school district that wanted to set up this kind of program, Platt said. We know it works.</p>
