			<p>University of Central Florida President John Hitt presented a formal request to the Board of Governors on Thursday, Nov. 17, to establish a medical college in Orlando that would help address a critical doctor shortage, improve health care and provide billions of dollars in economic benefit.</p><p>Hitt spoke during the boards meeting at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. He was joined by Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and other supporters from Central Florida hospitals and the community.</p><p>The Board of Governors expects to vote on <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=00240041603497a010714bf2afc007a32">UCFs proposal</a> and another by Florida International University in March.</p><p>Going into Thursdays presentation, UCF had added five more $1 million donations for the proposed medical college from Bank of America, the Elizabeth Morse Genius Foundation, Hughes Supply Inc., Darden Restaurants chairman Joe Lee, and Larry and Janet Pino. Osceola and Seminole counties also have agreed to contribute $100,000 each, bringing UCF's fund-raising total for the college building and library to $31.9 million. With state matching funds, the total increases to $62.4 million. </p><p>The Central Florida community has clearly demonstrated its support for establishing a medical college in Orlando through its overwhelming generosity, Hitt said. The university has worked hard to show that there is a great need for additional medical education and that UCF is well-positioned to support it, and the community has recognized that.</p><p>According to the universitys proposal, the medical college and its degree would capitalize on the universitys strengths in biomedical sciences, modeling and simulation, and optics and photonics while fulfilling the states need for more physicians.</p><p>If approved by the state, the college would be established in fall 2006. The degree calls for a four-year curriculum that begins clinical education in fall 2008 and would produce about 120 medical graduates each year. Students also would have opportunities to study at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine and to participate in research programs.</p><p>Florida needs at least two more medical schools to address the growing demand for doctors in the state, according to a study by MGT of America. The annual need for new physicians in Florida is expected to grow from 2,800 in 2003 to 4,200 in 2021.</p><p>A medical college in Orlando, the largest metropolitan area in the country without such a school, would help improve health care in Central Florida and inject millions of dollars into the area economy, according to several studies. Other medical schools in the state average more than $2.7 billion each in annual economic impact.</p><p>The latest donations bolster UCFs case for establishing a medical college and demonstrate its widespread support in the Central Florida community. Orlando-based Hughes Supply and Bank of America, for example, cited the proposed colleges impact in making their contributions.</p><p>In the over 75 years that we have grown our business in Central Florida, we have demonstrated a strong commitment to helping our communities develop and thrive through smart, strategic growth initiatives and corporate responsibility programs, said Hughes Supply President and CEO Tom Morgan. We believe UCFs medical school will directly improve health care throughout Central Florida by increasing the numbers of health care professionals in our community and improving the quality of life for our residents.</p><p>&quot;We invest in institutions that are considered &quot;anchors&quot; of our communities,&quot; added Ed Timberlake, the Central Florida president for Bank of America. &quot;This is a component of our local giving strategy - investing in established institutions whose work contributes to economic and community development.  Our support of the UCF medical school is an investment in intellectual capital, human capital and physical capital that will help strengthen the Central Florida community for decades to come.&quot;</p><p>In early October, Tavistock Group, a private investment company that owns the Lake Nona and Isleworth communities, pledged $12.5 million in cash and 50 acres of land valued at more than $8 million to establish the UCF Healthcare Campus at Lake Nona, where the medical college would be located if it is approved.</p><p>Tavistock challenged the community to match its pledge to raise a total of $25 million. </p><p>To date, 15 corporations, organizations, couples and others -- including Bank of America, the Genius Foundation, Hughes Supply, Joe Lee, and Larry and Janet Pino -- have stepped up with donations of $1 million or more each for the medical college. They will be named founders of the college if it is approved.</p><p>The Maitland-based Alan and Harriet Ginsburg Family Foundation Inc. donated $4 million and will have the college library named in its honor. Winter Park real estate investor and developer Steve Walsh and his wife, Paula, gave $2.5 million. And Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare gave a combined $2 million.</p><p>Other donors that have given $1 million each are Avalon Park developer Beat Kahli and his wife, Jill; The Martin Andersen-Gracia Andersen Foundation Inc.; UCF Board of Trustees Chair Dick Nunis and his wife, Mary; and The Winter Park Health Foundation.</p><p>In addition, Orange County has pledged to match up to another $1 million in grants from the other 10 counties in UCFs service area for a possible total of $3 million, including its initial grant. The public funds are not eligible for a state match.</p><p>Last year, Al and Nancy Burnett donated $10 million that in part will be used with state matching and construction funds to pay for the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences building, which would be located with the medical college if it is approved. The biomedical sciences college has been established and will be built regardless of the decision on the medical college.</p>
