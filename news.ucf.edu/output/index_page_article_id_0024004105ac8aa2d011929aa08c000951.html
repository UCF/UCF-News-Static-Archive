			<p>From cramped quarters in Phillips Hall to its own building and meditation garden, UCF&rsquo;s honors college has grown in more than size during the past decade.</p>
<p>Its students and faculty are part of a culture of academic excellence, which inspires lifelong learning and civic responsibility.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 4, The Burnett Honors College celebrated its 10th anniversary at the University of Central Florida and kicked off a year of events and activities for honors students, faculty and alumni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of its history and its accomplishments,&rdquo; UCF President John Hitt told a crowd of about&nbsp;75 gathered in the college building&rsquo;s atrium Friday evening.</p>
<p>University leaders and Burnett Honors College Dean Alvin Wang unveiled a new aluminum flying-horse sculpture, &ldquo;Wind Dancer.&rdquo; It is the largest 3-D Pegasus statue on campus and was created by a former UCF employee and award-winning sculptor, Mindy Colton.</p>
<p>Also announced was the recipient of the first Allyn M. Stearman Scholarship, named after the college&rsquo;s founding dean. Naomi Brownstein, a senior in the college majoring in actuarial science and mathematics, was recognized. She is also an Honors in the Major student, part of UCF&rsquo;s oldest and most prestigious undergraduate research program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The college&rsquo;s yearlong anniversary celebration will continue with student research showcases and alumni events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing how much everything has grown,&rdquo; said Nancy Burnett, who attended Friday&rsquo;s reception with her husband, Al. &ldquo;When we first set foot on this campus, there were two or three buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Burnetts made possible the college&rsquo;s 10,250-square-foot-building, which opened in 2002. The couple has generously donated to the honors college and other campus institutions, including the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences in the College of Medicine.</p>
<p>While The Burnett Honors College is &ldquo;young,&rdquo; UCF&rsquo;s honors program is in its 26th year, Wang said. The college enrolls about 500 new students each fall, compared to fewer than 30 who started in UCF&rsquo;s original Honors Program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each year our class is growing in terms of quality,&rdquo; Wang said. &ldquo;We are truly taking the best and the brightest, and we are increasingly the honors college of first choice among our freshmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest batch of students boasted an average SAT score of 1361 and an above-4.0 high school GPA.</p>
<p>In the classroom, the college offers in-depth, advanced and interdisciplinary courses ranging from genetic engineering to the history of baseball.</p>
<p>The college also exposes students to a variety of academic enrichment and community or service-learning programs.</p>
<p>The college&rsquo;s Honors Educational Reach Out, or HERO program, has touched thousands of elementary school students in Central Florida through teaching leadership in the classroom and at after-school programs and helping children learn to read. In just more than three years, its freshman symposium has become the largest service-learning partnership in the country linking an honors college, public schools and the nonprofit Junior Achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to give our students a well-rounded experience,&rdquo; said Kelly Astro, the director of Research and Civic Engagement for the college. &ldquo;We want them to do well academically, but also experience what it means to give back to the community and to be engaged and responsible citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honors students are also encouraged to get involved on campus. Last year, the college partnered with Housing and Residence Life to create a living-learning community in Tower III. A state-of-the-art classroom extends learning opportunities to the residence halls, giving faculty the chance to participate in student gatherings.</p>
<p>Honors students also have access to a reading room, computer lab and multimedia classrooms at six-year-old The Burnett Honors College building, which also features a tropical meditation garden.</p>
<p>Notable honors alumni include UCF&rsquo;s first Rhodes Scholar, Tyler Fisher, who is now studying European literature at Oxford University.&nbsp; Fisher graduated in 2002 with a 4.0 GPA and degrees in English and Spanish after successfully defending his thesis -- an English translation of Cuban Jose Marti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ismaelillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Fisher sought help from the college&rsquo;s Honors Study Abroad Scholarship, Lalita Booth worked with the Office of Student Scholarship and Fellowship Advisement -- also housed in the college -- on her recent Truman Scholar application. Last week, Booth, a Burnett Honors College junior, was announced as UCF&rsquo;s first winner of the highly prestigious national award for college student leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, the success of The Burnett Honors College is measured by the success of its alumni who embrace the pursuit of life-long learning, become engaged citizens of the global community, and go on to become leaders in their field,&rdquo; Wang said.</p>
