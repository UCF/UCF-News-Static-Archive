			<p>In honor of the life of Eddie Robinson, the board of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports (NCAS) has created a new award that will be presented annually to players, coaches or others in the world of sport who exemplify the courage to always stand up for justice for the people they lead.</p><p>The Eddie Robinson Leadership Award this year will be awarded to Rutgers womens basketball coach C. Vivian Stringer and her team. </p><p>The consortium is based at the University of Central Florida and is led by Richard Lapchick, who also heads UCFs DeVos Sport Business Management Program and the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.</p><p>Lapchick praised Coach Stringer and her team for how they responded to comments by talk show host Don Imus that sparked a national discussion on racism and sexism.</p><p>Coach Stringer and her team took adversity and turned it into another victory, Lapchick said. The dignity they showed America forced us as a nation to look at all the ways we objectify and demean women. They may be helping us to change the culture.&quot;</p><p>The award will be presented at the NCAS' Giant Steps Award Banquet and Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony held in Orlando. The NCAS inducted Eddie Robinson in the first class of inductees into its Hall of Fame in 1999. Coach Robinson then helped induct Muhammad Ali in 2000.</p><p>Coach Robinson was a great person, family man, coach and American -- a genuine leader, Lapchick said. We want to honor that legacy by honoring other leaders who have stood tall for justice. The Eddie Robinson Leadership Award is the NCAS' way to do that.</p><p>Robinson's career lasted through 11 presidents and three wars. He coached for 56 years, all at the same institution. In spite of having more wins than any other coach, sending more than 300 players to NFL camps, having a graduation rate of 80 percent when football graduation rates were around 50 percent, and never having had a player get in trouble with the law until his 56th year of coaching, Robinson was never offered an interview for a Division I-A university head coaching job.  </p><p>When he retired in November 1997, many people in America stood up and took note for the first time of the winningest coach in the history of college football. He was likely the best known coach in America in the African-American community and was surely the most beloved. However, many of society's racial barriers kept Robinson a secret from most of white America outside of the world of sports. Robinson, who began his career in a segregated society, helped football transcend race.</p><p>Stringer is the first coach in men's or women's basketball to take three different schools to<br />the Final Four. She coached Cheyney University in 1982, Iowa in 1993 and Rutgers in 2000. In 2007, Rutgers returned to the Final Four but lost the championship game to Tennessee. Stringer finished her 36th season with a 777-260 overall record, and she is the third women's coach to notch 750 career Division I victories.</p><p>Under Stringer's guidance, the Scarlet Knights have become more than students and athletes during their careers -- they have become citizens and role models as well. Stringer has stressed community involvement and education as often as she has stressed her aggressive and intense defensive game plan.</p><p>The Rutgers women's basketball team chose to react to Imus' comments with grace and dignity, determined to show the country what a classy, educated and successful group of women they are. The women used their hurt and sadness to educate Don Imus and millions of Americans that words really can hurt.  </p><p>On being notified that she and her players had won the Eddie Robinson Leadership Award, Stringer said, &quot;I am delighted Rutgers women's basketball was chosen for this prestigious honor.  Eddie Robinson was a pioneer, and his legacy is one that will be remembered for generations to come. I believe the 10 young women that represent the Scarlet Knights epitomize the leadership and courage Coach Robinson taught his players.&quot;</p>
