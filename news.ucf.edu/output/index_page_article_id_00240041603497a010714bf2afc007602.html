			<p>Joining a community effort to improve health care in Central Florida, Winter Park residents Steve and Paula Walsh will give $2.5 million to the University of Central Florida to help establish a medical college in Orlando, the university announced today.</p><p>The Walshes donation caps off Tavistock Groups challenge to the community to match its $12.5 million gift, bringing UCFs total private fund-raising effort to $25 million and bolstering its case for the proposed medical college.</p><p>&quot;The overwhelming community response to support the creation of a medical college has been impressive and inspiring,&quot; UCF President John Hitt said. &quot;We are extremely grateful that Steve and Paula Walsh have stepped forward to ensure that we reached this ambitious fund-raising goal.&quot;</p><p>UCF will present its formal proposal to establish a medical college to the state Board of Governors, which oversees Floridas 11 public universities, at the boards Nov. 17 meeting in Jacksonville. Florida International University is also requesting a medical college.</p><p>Steve Walsh is the managing partner and founder of Broad Street Partners, a real estate investment and development company that has offices in Winter Park and Charleston, S.C. The company has projects throughout the Southeast, including Tradition Towers -- a 39-story condominium high-rise set to begin construction early next year in downtown Orlando.</p><p>&quot;Paula and I have been considering meaningful ways to contribute in the community, because Orlando has given us so much,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;We chose to support the proposed medical school because of the need for more doctors in Central Florida and because Florida currently imports 90 percent of its new doctors from other states. These are exciting times for Orlando, and we are proud to be a part of UCF.&quot;</p><p>Walsh has been involved in real estate development, construction, finance and management for more than 30 years. He has also been active in other business and financial endeavors. Broad Street Partners currently has more than $1 billion in developments in progress.</p><p>In early October, Tavistock Group, a private investment company that owns the Lake Nona and Isleworth communities, pledged $12.5 million in cash and 50 acres of land valued at more than $8 million to establish the UCF Healthcare Campus at Lake Nona, where the medical college would be located if it is approved.</p><p>Tavistock challenged the community to match its pledge to raise a total of $25 million. Combined with an additional dollar-for-dollar state match, the Tavistock gift and community challenge donations could result in $50 million total that would pay for the college building and library.</p><p>To date, eight corporations, organizations and couples who will be named &quot;founders&quot; of the college, including the Walshes, have stepped up with donations of $1 million or more each.</p><p>The Maitland-based Alan and Harriet Ginsburg Family Foundation Inc. donated $4 million and will have the college library named in its honor. Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare gave a combined $2 million.</p><p>Other donors that have given $1 million each are Avalon Park developer Beat Kahli and his wife, Jill; The Martin Andersen-Gracia Andersen Foundation Inc.; UCF Board of Trustees Chair Dick Nunis and his wife, Mary; and The Winter Park Health Foundation.</p><p>In addition, Orange County has pledged $1 million and will match up to another $1 million of grants provided by the other 10 counties in UCFs service area for a possible total of $3 million. The public funds are not eligible for a state match.</p><p>Last year, Al and Nancy Burnett donated $10 million that in part will be used with state matching and construction funds to pay for the <a href="http://www.biomed.ucf.edu/">Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences</a> building, which would be located with the medical college if it is approved. The biomedical sciences college has been established and will be built regardless of the decision on the medical college.</p><p>According to the universitys proposal, the medical college and its degree would capitalize on the universitys strengths in biomedical sciences, modeling and simulation, and optics and photonics while fulfilling the communitys need for more physicians.</p><p>If approved by the state, the college would be established in fall 2006. The degree calls for a four-year curriculum that begins clinical education in fall 2008 and would produce about 120 medical graduates each year.</p><p>Florida needs at least two more medical schools to address the growing demand for doctors in the state, according to a study by MGT of America. The annual need for new physicians in Florida is expected to grow from 2,800 in 2003 to 4,200 in 2021.</p><p>A medical college in Orlando, the largest metropolitan area in the country without such a school, would help improve health care in Central Florida and inject millions of dollars into the area economy, according to several studies. Other medical schools in the state average more than $2.7 billion each in annual economic impact.</p>
