He mentioned UCFs 11 nursing centers,                 the Center for Autism and Related Disabilities and a clinic that                 offers free counseling services to 1,100 Central Floridians a year.                 </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The average                 SAT score for UCF freshmen last fall was 1176, and the 34 National                 Merit scholars in the fall freshman class was the second highest                 total in the state, behind only the University of Florida, he said.</font></p>

This amounts to about two-thirds                 of the $82 million the Board of Governors estimated would be needed                 to meet the enrollment needs of our state universities.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We would appreciate                 your support for our efforts to gain enrollment funding if we are                 to honor our commitments to expand access to a quality education                 for our students and to attract high wage jobs to our region.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you heard                 in the video, the quality of our students just keeps getting better.                 Let me remind you once again just how good our students are.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The average                 SAT score for our 4,200+ full-time incoming freshmen this year was                 1176. The Burnett Honors College SAT average this fall was 1329                 for over 500 entering students, and the 34 National Merit scholars                 in the fall class ranked UCF second only to UF among the state universities                 in the number of National Merits we enrolled.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If access to                 a quality education continues to be one of our priorities, so is                 our accent on the individual.

He is the first student from UCF to be chosen for this prestigious                 scholarship and is currently studying at Oxford University and writing                 to us about having tea with the Queen. </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And just this                 past September, Ericka Dunlap, a member of the Presidents                 Leadership Council, was named Miss America for 2004.

UCF-affiliated housing adjacent to the campus                 adds 3,756 additional beds, bringing the total number of beds to                 8,015.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our new shuttle                 service transports between four and six thousand students each day                 to the campus from surrounding apartment complexes. According to                 a recent survey, nearly 80 percent of these students would have                 driven their cars onto campus if the shuttles had not been not available.                 In addition, we operate an on-campus shuttle for the convenience                 of our students and to help cut down on traffic.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You or one of                 your neighbors, friends, family members, or colleagues has probably                 benefited from one of UCFs many outreach programs. </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our nursing                 students provide medical services to nearly 40,000 people at 11                 community nursing centers in Apopka, Bithlo, Cocoa, Melbourne, Merritt                 Island, Sanford, and Winter Parkas well as Orlando. </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our Center for                 Autism and Related Disabilities serves more than 1,300 children                 and adults.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UCF Community                 Counseling Clinic offers free individual and family counseling sessions                 to nearly 1,100 Central Floridians each year.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tens of thousands                 of Central Floridians come to campus each year to attend conferences,                 athletic contests, and arts events. The UCF Arena hosted more than                 225,000 people last year at events ranging from volleyball camps                 and basketball games to robotics competitions. The Golden Knights                 welcomed nearly 100,000 fans to the Citrus Bowl last seasonand                 we expect the attendance to rise considerably next fall as Coach                 George OLeary guides our football team to victory.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Shaping our                 academic and research programs to meet the needs of our region is                 embodied in our mission as a metropolitan research university.</b></font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new Rosen                 School of Hospitality Management, a 159,000-square-foot campus,                 just opened on a 20-acre site in the heart of Central Floridas                 tourist corridor.

We already participate in an accelerated                 medical school program with the University of South Florida College                 of Medicine. Don Jernigan, president of Florida Hospital and John                 Hillenmayer, president of ORHS, support a feasibility study, and                 Kenneth Bradley, Senior Vice President and Administrator of Winter                 Park Hospital wrote recently to offer his support. He commented                 that Orlando is the largest city in the U.S. without a medical school                 and is home to two of the largest hospitals in the U.S. </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our decision                 to pursue the establishment of a medical school is recognition of                 the expanding health care needs of one of the fastest growing regions                 in the nation. A medical school in a city the size of Orlando is                 not a luxury but a necessity as our population continues to increase                 in numbers and in age. </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also consistent                 with the research currently underway at UCF where our faculty are                 exploring ways to cure cancer, prevent cardiovascular disease, treat                 brain injuries, and understand Crohns disease.

With a $68 million                 match in funds from the partnering companies, the Council has dedicated                 more than $102 million to corridor companies working on projects                 in aviation and aerospace, information technology, medical technologies,                 microelectronics, optics and photonics, and modeling, simulation,                 and training.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The companies                 housed at the UCF High Tech Incubator hold 47 trademarks, 64 trade                 secrets, 74 copyrights, and 286 patentsand </font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">revenues generated                 for 2003 are projected to top $75 million.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, it is                 impossible to imagine Central Florida without the University of                 Central Florida. It is also hard to imagine that, in just 40 years,                 what was once a small school in a small town has risen from promise                 to prominence and is now nationally and internationally recognized                 as a leading metropolitan research university located in a world-class                 community. The university is now the sixth largest employer in the                 region, with a current operating budget exceeding a half a billion                 dollars and a payroll of approximately two hundred and thirteen                 million dollars.</font></p>              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be                 no great city without a great universityand no university                 can be truly great without the support of the community it calls                 home.
