			<p>Three exceptional athletes, an outstanding philanthropist and the founder of the Knights&rsquo; men&rsquo;s tennis team will be inducted into the UCF Athletics Hall of Fame next month.</p>
<p>Joining 54 previous UCF athletics greats to be enshrined into the Hall of Fame will be former letterwinners Elgin Davis (football) and Kim Wyant (women's soccer) in the Legendary Knights category; Michael O'Shaughnessy (football) in the Distinguished Letterwinner category; and a pair of Honorary Letterwinners, the late Wayne Densch, for his tremendous philanthropy throughout the history of UCF Athletics, and UCF men's tennis founder Lex Wood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five outstanding individuals will be honored at a dinner event the evening of Friday, April 16, in the J. Rolfe Davis Recruiting Room at Bright House Networks Stadium.&nbsp; The dinner will kick off the UCF Athletics&rsquo; Hall of Fame Weekend.</p>
<p>Now is your chance to be a part of the entire weekend for just $60 through the Hall of Fame Pass, which includes a ticket to the Hall of Fame Induction Dinner on Friday night, the UCF Spring Football Game and a barbecue plate at the UCF Pigskin Barbecue &amp; Fan Day on Saturday and a weekend pass to the UCF baseball series against Rice.</p>
<p>To purchase a Hall of Fame Pass through the Golden Knights Club, please call 407-823-2086 or e-mail <a href="mailto:GoldenKnightsClub@athletics.ucf.edu">GoldenKnightsClub@athletics.ucf.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The class will be honored during the UCF Spring Football Game on Saturday, with on-field recognition to the audience of thousands in attendance at Bright House Networks Stadium.</p>
<p>The UCF Athletics Hall of Fame was established in 1998 and has now honored 59 former coaches, athletes and administrators. For longer descriptions of the five inductees, click <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/genrel/031510aaf.html">here</a>&nbsp;to read the UCF&nbsp;Athletics news release.</p>
<p><strong>Elgin Davis - Football - Legendary Knight</strong></p>
<p>Elgin Davis was a four-year star for the Knights football program from 1983-86, playing both the fullback and running back positions for coaches Lou Saban and Gene McDowell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis evolved into the most prolific runner in school history at the time. He completed his collegiate career at UCF with nearly all the school's career rushing records. During his junior and senior year, Davis was a Dean's List recipient and was voted captain of the football team.</p>
<p>He finished his career -- all four years as a starter -- with 2,064 yards on 464 rushes (4.4 yard average) and 23 touchdowns.</p>
<p>In 1987, the New England Patriots drafted Davis into the NFL, and he became the second player ever drafted out of UCF. He played two seasons before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers and later the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League.</p>
<p>He ended his career with the London Monarchs of the World Football League. Shortly afterwards, Davis later the call to ministry, and he worked diligently within his community to help correct many political and social ills that affect society.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Densch - Philanthropy - Honorary Letterwinner</strong></p>
<p>On Oct. 22, 1986, a plaque was placed in the breezeway of the two Athletics Department buildings renaming the complex the Wayne Densch Sports Center in honor of one of the Central Florida region's greatest philanthropists. The gift to UCF Athletics would be the start of a long-standing relationship with the Densch family and the Wayne M. Densch Charitable Trust.</p>
<p>Wayne Densch, who passed away in May 1994, grew up and was educated in Louisville, Ky.&nbsp; He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941 and served during World War II in the South Pacific as a Communications Officer for the 33rd Infantry Division. He was awarded the Bronze Star.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wayne Densch, Inc. has been the leading Anheuser-Busch distributor in Florida for many years. Each year, Wayne Densch, Inc. sponsors and participates in numerous charitable events to benefit the Central Florida community. Densch and his wife, Ann, supported a variety of charitable causes, including the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the Red Cross, Shrine Burn Centers and Hospitals and many University of Central Florida activities.</p>
<p>The Wayne M. Densch Charitable Trust continues its support of UCF Athletics to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Michael O'Shaughnessy - Football - Distinguished Letterwinner</strong></p>
<p>A two-sport athlete for the Fighting Knights (baseball and football), O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was a standout defensive lineman for the UCF football team during the program's first two seasons in 1979 and 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>O'Shaughnessy established a still-standing school record for sacks in a game with five against Emory &amp; Henry in 1979. He remains among UCF's all-time best with 22 career sacks.</p>
<p>O'Shaughnessy has served UCF Athletics in many roles for decades. He was an assistant offensive line coach in 1981, the founder and first president of the UCF Letterman's K Club, a member of the Knights Booster Board of Directors and the UCF football's radio sideline reporter from 1990 to 94. He was also a member of the 1979 baseball team, which was the school's first championship baseball team as part of the Sunshine State Conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Off the field, O'Shaughnessy was designated as the Alumnus of the Decade for the 1980s at the school's 40th anniversary celebration. He co-founded with his wife, Leslie, the Millennium Woman Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has funded more than 250 educational scholarships to single-parent women nationwide.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Alexander Wood - Men's Tennis - Honorary Letterwinner</strong></p>
<p>Alexander &quot;Lex&quot; Wood began the UCF men's tennis program in 1970 and served as the Knights' head coach for six seasons through his retirement following the 1977 dual match season.&nbsp; The first two seasons of his tenure the Knights competed at the club level, compiling a 24-10 combined record from 1972-73.</p>
<p>The momentum Wood garnered those first two initial seasons on campus led to the approval of his fledgling tennis program to join NCAA Division II competition beginning in 1974.&nbsp; From that point forward, the men's tennis team never looked back and instantly became a Top 20 squad at that level until the time it joined Division I in the early 1980's.</p>
<p>Under Wood, the men's tennis team went a combined 102-46, including an impressive 30-4 mark in 1977, his final campaign. His final season was highlighted by UCF claiming the inaugural Sunshine State Conference tennis championship, the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Division II South Regional and a third-place finish at the NCAA Division II National Championship tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After his coaching retirement, Wood would go on to serve a long tenure teaching in UCF's physical education department.</p>
<p><strong>Kim Wyant - Women's Soccer - Legendary Knight </strong></p>
<p>Kim Wyant began and ended her UCF women's soccer career in similar fashion. The Miami native was named the team's rookie of the year as a goalkeeper in 1982. In her senior season in 1985, Wyant was named the team's MVP, while earning first-team All-American honors.&nbsp; She went on to great things in women's soccer, as a member and starter on the first United States women's national team and then as a prominent pro in the U.S.-based W-League.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a UCF freshman, Wyant started in the first-ever Women's NCAA National Championship, a game the Knights lost 2-0 to North Carolina. Despite the loss, she was named the tourney's Most Valuable Player. The championship game marked one of many soccer 'firsts' for Wyant and helped grow the sport for women.</p>
<p>A story once stated that she &ldquo;is to U.S. Women's soccer what Ringo Starr is to Rock and Roll, an original member of the group who set the stage for today's soccer mega-stars. Before there was a Mia Hamm, or even a Brandi Chastain, there was Kim Wyant and the rest of the first-ever U.S. Women's National Team.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wyant made 16 overall appearances for the U.S. National Team and started the very first U.S. women's international match in 1985 in Jesolo, Italy. She would carry the distinction of being the first goalkeeper in U.S. history, and she recorded America's first win and first shutout.&nbsp;</p>
