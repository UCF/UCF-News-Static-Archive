			<p>UCF students, faculty and staff excel in the classroom, in research labs and on the athletic fields while also volunteering their time and talents throughout the community. Alumni succeed in the boardroom, classroom and performing arts in Central Florida and throughout the rest of the country.</p>
<p>On this page, UCF will recognize some of the many success stories that are points of pride for the university community. Suggestions for new Points of Pride can be submitted to News and Information through Chad Binette, <a href="mailto:cbinette@mail.ucf.edu">cbinette@mail.ucf.edu</a>, or Grant Heston, <a href="mailto:gheston@mail.ucf.edu">gheston@mail.ucf.edu</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Outstanding freshman class: </strong>UCF, the sixth-largest university in the nation with more than 50,000 students, attracted a record 62 National Merit Scholars in fall 2008. The fall freshman class posted an average SAT score of 1219, a more than 50-point increase since 2002. Even more impressive, the fall freshman class at the prestigious Burnett Honors College posted an average SAT score of 1370.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol prevention honors: </strong>UCF won the Prevention Excellence Award highest honors among schools nationwide for its alcohol prevention and education efforts. The university was recognized by Outside the Classroom for creating a safer and healthier campus by developing, implementing and sustaining innovative alcohol education programming.</p>
<p><b>GI Bill success: </b>According to <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education, </i>UCF ranks 18<sup>th</sup> in the country for institutions that enroll the most students with GI Bill benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Outstanding graduate programs: </strong>UCF&rsquo;s Electrical Engineering program was ranked number 65 in the nation in the 2009 U.S. News and World Report Best Graduate School guide. Education, Physics, Public Administration and Speech-Language Pathology also placed in the top 100 nationally.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Successful scholarship campaign: </strong>Students in the inaugural class at the UCF&rsquo;s College of Medicine will pursue for free their dreams of becoming medical doctors. The community fully funded 40 scholarships for the class during a first-of-its-kind fund-raising campaign. Each student will receive a four-year scholarship worth $160,000 &ndash; about $20,000 for tuition and $20,000 for living expenses and fees each year.</p>
<p><strong>Analyzing water problems: </strong>The Coastal Hydroscience Analysis, Modeling &amp; Predictive Simulations (CHAMPS) Lab helps communities and government agencies solve water-related problems. Led by Associate Professor Scott Hagen, the lab develops tidal models on a high-performance computing cluster provided by HP. Hagen and his research team are striving to improve river forecast systems for storm surges, with a goal of making emergency advisories more accurate. More: <a href="http://champs.cecs.ucf.edu/">http://champs.cecs.ucf.edu/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Three coveted internships: </strong>UCF Cardiopulmonary Sciences students Angela Gutierrez, Van Lewark and Christine Kearney earned three of five coveted 24-month internships in pediatric respiratory care at the world-famous Duke Medical Center. The three will get intense postgraduate training leading to careers as pediatric respiratory care specialists.</p>
<p><strong>Boosting the economy:</strong> UCF and its neighbor, the Central Florida Research Park, provide a total economic impact of $3.5 billion and affect more than 45,000 jobs. The research park also is home to the award-winning UCF Technology Incubator, which was created to provide fledgling businesses the support they need to be successful and contribute to the economic strength of the region.</p>
<p><strong>Serving the community:</strong> Freshmen at UCF&rsquo;s Burnett Honors College regularly visit underserved youths at Orange County elementary schools and teach them about leadership, local government, democracy and more. About 500 honors students taught more than 9,000 grade-school children in the fall. In just more than three years, the program has become the largest service-learning partnership in the country linking an honors college, public schools and the nonprofit Junior Achievement.</p>
<p><strong>On top of their game:</strong>&nbsp; Sixty-three students have graduated from the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, UCF&rsquo;s graduate video-gaming school, since it opened its doors in August 2005. Nearly all of the students have landed jobs in their industry of choice, and their average starting salary is $51,588. The new House of Moves motion-capture studio, located with FIEA in a building across from Amway Arena, will further enhance educational opportunities for current and future FIEA students.</p>
<p><strong>Black, gold and green: </strong>A 1,600-square-foot green roof on top of the Student Union includes Florida-native plants that help to conserve energy and reduce storm-water runoff. Since becoming the first university in the state to install a green roof in 2005, UCF has helped many other communities, including Sarasota and Sanford, adopt green roofs. UCF also became the first university in the state last fall to convert one of its fleet vehicles to a plug-in hybrid for limited all-electric driving.</p>
<p><strong>Alumni pride:</strong> A graduate of the College of Education, Richard Ellenburg was selected as Florida&rsquo;s 2007 Teacher of the Year out of 180,000 teachers across the state. A two-time Orange County Teacher of the Year, Ellenburg is an elementary science-lab teacher who inspires his students with everything from snakes to an electric guitar.</p>
