			<p>The Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government at the University of Central Florida and the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida&nbsp;on Thursday&nbsp;unveiled a unique partnership, establishing the Florida Joint Center for Citizenship -- a&nbsp; primary resource to help strengthen civic education in the state.</p>
<p>An outgrowth of the bi-partisan civic education initiative Graham and Frey launched last year, the center will promote the development of enlightened, responsible and actively engaged citizens and will lead efforts to improve the teaching and learning of civics in Florida schools. The center will be housed at UCF.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I support and applaud the efforts of two of our state&rsquo;s most distinguished and respected statesmen,&rdquo; said Gov. Charlie Crist. &ldquo;It is a critically important issue. Florida&rsquo;s future is in the hands of children who are now in school. The issues are not going to get easier. We have to be sure that all young people have the knowledge to make sound policy choices and the skills to make their voices heard in the political process. I want to encourage others to support this work as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the leadership of former Sen. Graham and former Congressman Frey, the center will work to coordinate efforts to improve civics education in Florida and provide leadership to help make civics a priority in Florida&rsquo;s teacher education programs. It will also encourage the use of classroom materials that help students understand government in the state and in communities where they live. Periodically, the center will report to the citizens of Florida on the state of Florida&rsquo;s civic culture.</p>
<p>One of the center&rsquo;s first initiatives will be to implement a statewide professional development training program for middle school teachers. Helios Education Foundation is partnering with the center on this initiative and is providing a community investment of $556,466 toward the program. As a result of these funds, the center will be offering weekly training programs for middle school teachers statewide during the summers of 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helios Education Foundation is focused on changing lives through education, and our greatest area of emphasis is the middle school years, including teacher professional development,&rdquo; said the Foundation&rsquo;s President and CEO Paul Luna. &ldquo;We are pleased to invest over $556,000 in the Florida Joint Center for Citizenship, a multi-university, public-private collaboration that will ultimately improve the quality of civics education statewide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opportunity to partner with Helios Education Foundation provides the Joint center with an immediate opportunity to make an important difference,&rdquo; Graham said. &ldquo;We are grateful to the foundation for its willingness to make an investment in the quality of citizenship. Florida&rsquo;s future depends on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frey added that the Florida Legislature has already recognized the weakness of civic education in the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why they passed House Bill 7087 in 2006, which requires school districts to offer at least one semester of civics in middle schools,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When they passed that bill, the Legislature took a first important step to restoring the civic mission of Florida&rsquo;s schools. The project that the Joint center is undertaking, thanks to the support of Helios Education Foundation, will help to realize the Legislature&rsquo;s intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teachers participating in the weeklong summer training program will be able to do so at no cost. As part of the training program, they will participate in a curriculum centered on providing students with the history and principles of constitutional democracy in the United States. The curriculum also promotes critical thinking, problem solving and the development of important civic skills. It ultimately helps students understand what they need to know to be effective citizens. The program will build on a curriculum developed by the Center for Civic Education and promoted by its long-time Florida partner, the Florida Law Related Education Association, Inc.</p>
<p>The Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government at UCF is a nonpartisan foundation that engages in civic education for college and high school students and members of the Central Florida community. The institute promotes informed discussion of issues from diverse viewpoints, encourages participation in the political process and supports research on politics and policy. Frey, a Republican, represented
