			<p>Donnie Jones, one of the nation's premier recruiters and a rising star in the coaching community, has been selected as the head coach of the UCF men's basketball program, director of athletics and executive vice president Keith Tribble announced Monday.&nbsp; Jones recently concluded his third season as the head coach at Marshall, where he quickly turned around the Thundering Herd program.</p>
<p>On Tuesday at 2 p.m., Jones will formally be introduced to the UCF community during a press conference at the UCF Arena. Live video of the press conference will be available at <a href="http://www.UCFAthletics.com">www.UCFAthletics.com</a>.</p>
<p>Starting at 5:30 p.m., Jones will hold a meet-and-greet inside the Tradition Room at the UCF Baseball Complex. The Knights host Bethune-Cookman at 6:30 p.m., and Jones will throw out the ceremonial first pitch.</p>
<p>Parking for fans attending the press conference will be available in Garage F. Fans should enter through the UCF Arena front lobby.</p>
<p>&quot;Donnie Jones is an excellent coach, a phenomenal recruiter and a great person,&quot; Tribble said. &quot;We are thrilled to welcome Donnie and his family to Orlando and the UCF Athletics community. Donnie has a vision for this program that includes attracting top-notch student-athletes and competing for championships. He is the right coach to lead UCF men's basketball to the next level.&quot;</p>
<p>Prior to his time at Marshall, Jones served for 11 years as an assistant coach at Florida, helping the program claim a pair of national titles and make three trips to the Final Four.</p>
<p>During the 2009-10 campaign, Jones led Marshall to one of the best seasons in school history as the Herd went 24-10 and advanced to the second round of the CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The appearance was the first trip to the postseason for Marshall in 22 years. Marshall finished the year 11-5 in Conference USA play, tying the Herd for third in the league and serving as the school's best conference finish for the program since 2000-01.</p>
<p>To help accomplish this impressive turnaround, Jones attracted several top recruits to Marshall, including Hassan Whiteside, who led the nation in blocks this past season. Whiteside was named both the 2009-10 C-USA Freshman and Defensive Player of the Year, and garnered Freshman All-America Second Team honors from The Sporting News.</p>
<p>In three seasons at Marshall, Jones compiled a 55-41 record. After arriving in Huntington, W.Va., in 2007, Jones led the Herd to a 16-14 record during his inaugural campaign, giving Marshall its first winning season in seven years. He guided his team to victories over a pair of eventual NCAA Tournament squads in San Diego and Winthrop, and helped Marshall go 8-8 in C-USA play. In 2008-09, Marshall went 15-17 overall and 7-9 in league games.</p>
<p>A native of Point Pleasant, W.Va., Jones worked under Billy Donovan as an assistant coach at Florida from 1996-07. Jones helped the school make to three trips to the Final Four and back-to-back national championships in 2006 and 2007. He played a key role in Florida's recruiting and player development that led to a school-record nine-consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, four Southeastern Conference Eastern Division titles and three SEC Tournament crowns.</p>
<p>During Jones' time at Florida, the program signed 11 McDonald's High School All-America selections and boasted consensus top-five national recruiting classes on five occasions.</p>
<p>Jones was promoted to Florida's associate head coach before the 2006-07 campaign. Before joining the Florida staff, he worked at Marshall for six years. He was a graduate assistant from 1990-92, and then was an assistant for four seasons.</p>
<p>Jones graduated from Pikeville (Ky.) College in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in business education. He earned his master's degree in sports management from Marshall in 1992. Jones had a stellar college playing career at Pikeville, recording a school-record 513 career assists. He served as the team's captain as a senior and finished second in the nation in the NAIA with 10.7 assists per game.</p>
<p>Jones and his wife, Michelle, have three children: Madisyn Michelle, Sofie Louise and Donald Isaac.</p>
