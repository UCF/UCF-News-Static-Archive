			<p>Ten University of Central Florida professors were awarded emeritus status Wednesday, April 2, at the annual Founders&rsquo; Day ceremony.</p>
<p>Emeritus professors have worked at the university for at least five years, and they have retired or are retiring this year. Emeritus status grants them a lifetime link to UCF and honors the major professional contributions and distinction that they achieved in their careers at the university.</p>
<p><b>Larry C. Andrews</b>, professor emeritus, retired in 2007 after teaching mathematics at UCF for 35 years and serving as graduate program coordinator for 15 years. He is an expert in electromagnetic waves in disordered media, with more than 100 publications and $3 million in research funding. He held joint appointments with Electrical and Computer Engineering and the College of Optics and Photonics, and he is a fellow of SPIE, the world&rsquo;s premier scientific society in optics and photonics.</p>
<p><b>Subir Bose</b>, professor emeritus, has served as a professor of Physics since 1987 and was the department chair from 1987 to 1994. Bose&rsquo;s research focuses on fundamental particle physics, chemical physics and few-photon quantum physics. He has served as chair of several committees and aided in the development of UCF&rsquo;s Quality Enhancement Plan. Bose is retiring at the end of the spring semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Donna Baumbach</b>, professor emerita, retired from the UCF faculty in August after 29 years of service in the Educational Research, Technology and Leadership Department.&nbsp; During her career at UCF, Baumbach received more than $20 million in funding. She also founded and directed the state-wide SUNLINK library database and the Instructional Technology Resource Center, both funded by Florida&rsquo;s Department of Education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fred Fedler</b>, professor emeritus, has been a key member of the Nicholson School of Communication&rsquo;s Journalism faculty since 1971. Fedler served at the head of the school&rsquo;s Journalism Division for 20 years and as coordinator of the school&rsquo;s graduate program for five years. He has published 66 articles and 4 books, including a textbook that is now in its eighth edition. Journalism Quarterly has named Fedler as the most productive researcher in the state in journalism and mass communication.</p>
<p><b>John A. Osborne</b>, professor emeritus, retired in August after 35 years of service as a Professor of Biology at UCF. His research and teaching have had a substantial impact on the study and management of aquatic biology throughout the state, and he continues to study the impact of invasive species on Central Florida lakes. In 1984, he was honored as UCF&rsquo;s Researcher of the Year. He has received additional awards from the Florida Lake Management Society and the Florida Benthological Society.</p>
<p><b>Mary J. Palmer</b>, professor emerita, was a faculty member at UCF for 37 years and is a member of the founding faculty of the College of Education. She led the Music Education program for many years and has served as the college&rsquo;s dean. A &ldquo;passionate and tenacious&rdquo; advocate for the role of the arts in educating Florida&rsquo;s youth, Palmer founded several programs used in elementary schools statewide and created the &ldquo;Connect With Music&rdquo; program that helps infants and toddlers develop their brains through music.</p>
<p><b>David F. Scott Jr.</b>, professor emeritus, has served as a professor of Finance and holder of the Phillips-Schenck Chair in American Private Enterprise for 24 years. He raised money to establish the Dr. Phillips Institute for the Study of American Business Activity and served as the institute&rsquo;s executive director for 17 years. Scott has published more than 40 articles in academic journals and several popular finance textbooks, and he is a founding co-editor of the Journal of Financial Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Allyn Stearman</b>, professor emerita, has served as a professor of Anthropology since 1976. She has worked at UCF for her entire career and was one of the original three members of the Anthropology faculty. Stearman is renowned for her work in Bolivia, and she has received a University Distinguished Researcher Award and a Teaching Incentive Program award. As a former dean of the Burnett Honors College, she helped to design the college&rsquo;s building, including the Meditation Garden.</p>
<p><b>Jack Stout</b>, professor emeritus, retired in October after serving as a professor of Biology for 35 years. Stout is a recognized expert on Florida&rsquo;s ecosystems and has served on many panels and advisory committees that have helped shape land management and conservation policies in Florida. He has received a Teaching Incentive Program award and a university award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching in 1999. Additionally, Stout has been an active member of several academic and conservation organizations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>LeVester Tubbs</b>, associate professor emeritus, retired in January after a long and distinguished career as a UCF administrator and a faculty member in the College of Education. He joined UCF as vice president for Student Affairs and an associate professor of Education, and he served on the President&rsquo;s Advisory Staff and the Academic Dean&rsquo;s Council. Tubbs also developed a Ph.D. program in Higher Education Student Personnel and served as its only full-time faculty member for a number of years.&nbsp;</p>
