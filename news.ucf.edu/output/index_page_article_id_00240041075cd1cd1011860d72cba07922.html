			<p>Boston University Professor Bahaa Saleh, the recipient of several top fellowships and awards in optics and electrical engineering, has been named the new dean of the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s College of Optics and Photonics.</p>
<p>Saleh has served as a professor and chairman of Boston University&rsquo;s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering since 1994. He is the deputy director of the National Science Foundation Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems and co-director of the Quantum Imaging Laboratory at BU.</p>
<p>As dean, Saleh will also&nbsp;direct the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL) housed within the College of Optics and Photonics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel great about my new role, and I look forward to the new challenge,&rdquo; Saleh said.</p>
<p>The College of Optics and Photonics enrolls 145 graduate students, and students from other colleges also work on their degrees in CREOL labs. The college also has 26 faculty members, 21 other faculty members with joint or courtesy appointments and 69 research scientists.</p>
<p>Saleh and current dean Eric Van Stryland will work together during the next several months to ensure a smooth transition of leadership at the college. Van Stryland has overseen UCF&rsquo;s optics programs for the past nine years; he originally accepted the position as a short-term appointment and now hopes to focus more on his research in nonlinear optics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known Bahaa for many years, and he is a great choice to lead us to the next level,&rdquo; Van Stryland said.</p>
<p>Saleh&rsquo;s research has covered a broad spectrum of topics in optics and photonics, including statistical and quantum optics, optical communication and signal processing, nonlinear optics, photodetectors, image processing, and vision. He is the author of two books, &ldquo;Photoelectron Statistics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fundamentals of Photonics,&rdquo; chapters in seven books and more than 500 papers in technical journals and conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Provost and Executive Vice President Terry Hickey said Saleh&rsquo;s extensive experience in optics and engineering fields, his research accomplishments and his desire to enhance partnerships within and outside of the university will make him a great asset to UCF and the Central Florida community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident that Dr. Saleh will build on the many successes that Eric Van Stryland has achieved at The College of Optics and Photonics during the past nine years,&rdquo; Hickey said. &ldquo;Our optics faculty are well-respected by their peers around the country, and their innovations increase our quality of life and spur the creation of high-paying jobs throughout Central Florida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2004, UCF&rsquo;s optics program became the first at a major U.S. university to be designated as a free-standing college. A year earlier, the Florida Photonics Center of Excellence was created with a $10 million state grant. The center enhanced the college&rsquo;s partnerships with industry and government and has helped to attract and retain photonics companies in the region.</p>
<p>In 2007, the college established a second center of excellence, the Townes Laser Institute, which focuses on the next generation of laser technologies for medicine, advanced manufacturing tools and defense. That center is named after Charles Hard Townes, the pioneer of the laser and a Nobel laureate.</p>
<p>Saleh is a member of the Boston University Photonics Center. An Electrical Engineering major, he received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Cairo University in 1966 and his Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins University in 1971. He served as a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin at Madison from 1977 to 1994, and he previously taught and conducted research at the University of Santa Catarina in Brazil, Kuwait University, the Max Planck Institute in Germany, the University of California at Berkeley, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Columbia University.</p>
<p>He is the recipient of the 1999 Optical Society of America Esther Hoffman Beller Award for outstanding contributions to optical science and engineering education, the 2004 SPIE BACUS award for his contribution to photomask technology, and the 2006 Kuwait Prize for his contributions to optical science. He served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of the Optical Society of America (OSA) from 1991 to 1997, and he is currently editor-in-chief of Advances in Optics and Photonics. He is a fellow of OSA; IEEE, a professional association devoted to the advancement of technology; and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.</p>
