			<p>Two central Florida business men -- one a volunteer with the Small Business Development Center at UCF and the other a client of the SBDC at UCF in Brevard -- were recently selected as recipients of two major U.S. Small Business Administration awards.</p>
<p>Don Kramer, a long-time client of the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s SBDC in Brevard, was named the 2008 Small Business Person of the Year for Florida. While C. Russell Slappey, a volunteer at UCF&rsquo;s SBDC, was named the 2008 SBA Financial Services Champion of the Year for the Southeast region.</p>
<p>UCF&rsquo;s SBDC in Brevard nominated Kramer, the owner and president of One Senior Place Inc., for his outstanding contributions to the community and small business development. With the creation of One Senior Place, Kramer has revolutionized the way Central Florida residents shop for senior services. Developed with technical assistance from the SBDC and an SBA loan, One Senior Place is a 13,000-square-foot, $3 million facility that acts as a one-stop shop for information, expert help and guidance, and a wide range of senior-focused businesses and service providers.</p>
<p>Kramer first came to UCF&rsquo;s SBDC in Brevard in 1997 and continued to turn to it for assistance. His civic leadership is recognized and highly valued in Central Florida, as he was named &ldquo;one of the innovators who drives Florida&rsquo;s economy&rdquo; by Florida Trend magazine. Kramer&rsquo;s shop was also named one of the &ldquo;50 Most Influential Businesses in Brevard&rdquo; by Space Coast Business Magazine.</p>
<p>Slappey was also nominated by the SBDC for the SBA Financial Services Champion of the Year award for his volunteer work with the group&rsquo;s Advisory Board Council. Slappey, a certified public accountant with more than 14 years of experience in accounting, information systems and taxation, is the managing partner of Nperspective, an Orlando-based firm offering CFO and controller services to small and mid-level companies in a variety of industries.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Slappey has established himself as a financial services community leader and donates a substantial amount of time to various community service groups. As an Advisory Board Council volunteer, he has served on three advisory boards and provided hundreds of pro-bono hours of financial consulting services to small business owners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to Don and Russell,&rdquo; said Thomas Keon, dean of UCF&rsquo;s College of Business Administration. &ldquo;Both recipients are successful business men and have made tremendous contributions to the community. They are truly deserving of recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Founded in 2003, the SBDC's Advisory Board Council is an Orange County-funded program which provides no-cost advisory board services to qualifying Orange County businesses through volunteer business professionals. Since its inception, the Advisory Board Council has served as matchmaker to over 90 small business clients, and approximately 400 area professionals have volunteered their expertise as members of the advisory boards. To date, the Advisory Board Council has<br />
utilized over $1.1 million worth of in-kind consulting service hours and estimates $42.7 million increase in client revenues.</p>
<p>The SBDC at UCF assisted 1,776 clients with one-on-one counseling in 2007. A total of 4,438 people attended training sessions held by the center. The SBDC estimates that it helped area entrepreneurs create or retain 1,815 jobs in 2007 and helped to generate an increase in sales of approximately $43.7 million.</p>
<p>With its main office in the Disney Entrepreneur Center in Downtown Orlando, the SBDC at UCF is part of the UCF College of Business Administration and the Florida Small Business Development Center Network, providing business seminars and free one-on-one business consultation to small business owners. The SBDC at UCF serves an eight-county area that includes Brevard, Flagler, Lake, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Sumter, and Volusia counties and maintains five satellite<br />
service centers. The SBDC at UCF is funded in part through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
