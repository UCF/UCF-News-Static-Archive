			<p>Lalita Booth has struggled with homelessness, a broken welfare system and single motherhood. Now she's working to end poverty for people suffering today.</p>
<p>At 27, Booth has accomplished near miracles since her teenage years, when she left her parents' home for friends' couches and the backs of Dumpsters. Later a single mom with no skills, she was forced to give her toddler to family who could afford to feed him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Booth is a double major in Finance and Accounting at the University of Central Florida. She's reunited with her 8-year-old son in a Sanford apartment, and she is running a financial literacy program for teens that she hopes will keep them from poverty.</p>
<p>Booth was recognized last week by the H. Truman Scholarship Foundation as one of 65 outstanding college student leaders in the country devoted to public service. She is this year's only winner from a Florida school.</p>
<p>Working out of her office in UCF's College of Business Administration, Booth created Lighthouse for Dreams, a local high-school outreach program that teaches teens to manage money. More than 100 students and faculty volunteers and many business professional and state organizations have joined to help the program.</p>
<p>&quot;We're graduating students who understand how to go into the workforce and be good employees, but don't understand how to make the paycheck they're receiving work for them in their lives,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Booth has the space, the support and the volunteers. She's waiting for high schools to devote 16 hours a year for those volunteers to spend in the classrooms, filling a void that she says has long been a part of Florida's education system.</p>
<p>Besides her high-school outreach program, Booth is working with state and U.S. lawmakers to improve Florida's financial literacy laws and reform welfare's work restrictions -- two major policy concerns she knows about first hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I have lived the reality that I'm trying to change for so many people,&quot; she said. &quot;Because I've been in those situations, I have a window of insight into what causes the problem and how to go about fixing it.&quot;</p>
<p>After leaving her parents at 16, Booth worked odd jobs in North Carolina and Colorado. She was well liked and quick to learn, but she turned down promotions so she wouldn't lose welfare benefits.</p>
<p>The system that was supposed to help her out of poverty, she says, was &quot;the very problem that perpetuated it.&quot;</p>
<p>The fear of forever losing her son, Kieren, eventually pulled her off the street.</p>
<p>&quot;For seven months I didn't see him, and I slept with his T-shirt every night,&quot; she said. &quot;I just couldn't give up on being somebody who would make him proud.&quot;</p>
<p>Booth moved to Florida and enrolled at Seminole Community College in 2004. She created a financial plan so she could feed and clothe herself and Kieren. She transferred to UCF in 2006.</p>
<p>Interning with U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney's and state Rep. Dean Cannon's offices this semester, she has proposed new bills that would offer financial literacy programs to emancipated teens and expand welfare work restrictions to include those programs.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're looking for someone who will change the world for the better, I believe that you have found her,&quot; said Jim Gilkeson, a UCF associate professor of Finance who has worked with Booth's outreach.</p>
<p>Booth was recently inducted to UCF's Order of Pegasus, the most prestigious student award given by the university. While at SCC, she received the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship for students of exceptional promise with financial needs.</p>
<p>The Truman Scholarship Foundation was established by Congress in 1975 for college students to attend graduate school in preparation for careers in government or elsewhere in public service.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all very meaningful to me,&quot; said Booth, a junior in UCF's Burnett Honors College. &quot;But I don't view them as accolades, I see them as tools -- and affirmation that I can make a difference.&quot;</p>
<p>After her anticipated graduation from UCF in 2009, Booth plans to attend Harvard Law School and continue her work in financial literacy.</p>
