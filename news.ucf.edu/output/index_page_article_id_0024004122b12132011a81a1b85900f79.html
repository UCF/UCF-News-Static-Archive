			<p>Trae Stewart has spent the past six years studying how service-learning affects high school and college students. He&rsquo;s explored the rewards and sometimes unexpected results of incorporating community volunteering into traditional classwork to expand students&rsquo; view of the world.</p>
<p>Stewart, an assistant professor in the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s College of Education, was recently recognized nationally and regionally for his service-learning research. He was named a 2008 John Glenn Scholar in Service-Learning from the public affairs school at The Ohio State University. Stewart received a $1,000 honorarium.</p>
<p>For the Southeast region, Stewart won the award for Outstanding Contributions to Research in Service-Learning from the Gulf-South Summit on Service-Learning and Civic Engagement in Higher Education, one of the largest annual conferences on the topic. His prized work focused on a first-year undergraduate service-learning class out of UCF&rsquo;s Burnett Honors College. Its Honors Symposium is the largest service-learning partnership in the country linking an honors college, public schools and the nonprofit Junior Achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honors program is so unique because it&rsquo;s really addressing more than just civic engagement in public schools,&rdquo; Stewart said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s assisting the transition for students into college and addressing that first-year experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About 500 honors freshmen each fall teach civics lessons to thousands of underprivileged elementary school students in Orange and Seminole counties as part of a required Burnett Honors College course.</p>
<p>Stewart found that the 119 freshmen surveyed showed a significant increase in confidence that they could make an impact in the community through service. But he also tracked a surprising decrease in their general self-efficacy -- a measure of overall feelings of competence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this type of research, such a decrease can actually be a pretty positive finding,&rdquo; Stewart said. As the students are exposed to different environments through the service-learning project, they realize it&rsquo;s going to take a collective effort to fix social inequities in schools and society, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arguably, it&rsquo;s because the cultural blinders they might have wore for so long have just been stripped away,&rdquo; Stewart said.</p>
<p>Burnett Honors leaders say the class provides opportunities for students to grow academically, personally and socially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this course, our students are exposed to the realities that many K-5 students face in Central Florida's schools, and they come to the realization that it truly will take the talent and intellect of all members of a community to help lift these and other schools to success,&rdquo; said Kelly Astro, the college&rsquo;s director of Research and Civic Engagement. &ldquo;It really does go back to the idea that &lsquo;it takes a village,&rsquo; but in this case not just to raise a child but to educate tomorrow's future.&nbsp; Dr. Stewart's work reflects this fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding service-learning projects to any course will benefit students, regardless of the academic field, said Stewart, whose students volunteer as part of all his classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If educators can help students make connections between the concepts they&rsquo;re learning about and every day life, they&rsquo;re more likely to be engaged in the classroom and apply those lessons in society,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;An added benefit to such experiential learning is when students simultaneously address a need in the community. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart teaches educational foundations classes at UCF&rsquo;s Daytona Beach and Orlando campuses. He earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in French and Spanish from the University of Mary Washington in Virginia and two masters&rsquo; degrees in International and Intercultural Education and Teaching English as a Second Language from the University of Southern California. Stewart also received his Ph.D. in 2003 from USC, where he researched service-learning&rsquo;s impacts on the development of social capital and critical consciousness in Catholic high school students.&nbsp; He is a member of the International Association for Research on Service-Learning and Community Engagement.</p>
<p><b>About the John Glenn Scholars: </b>Between 2004 and 2008, the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University has recognized scholars whose research efforts contribute to advancing the understanding of or adoption of service-learning, which specific emphasis on K-12 education.
