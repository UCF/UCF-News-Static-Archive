			<p>Seven University of Central Florida professors and two vice presidents were awarded emeritus status Wednesday, April 1, at the annual Founders&rsquo; Day ceremony.</p>
<p>Emeritus professors and vice presidents have worked at the university for at least five years, and they have retired or are retiring this year. Emeritus status grants them a lifetime link to UCF and honors the major professional contributions and distinction that they achieved in their careers at the university.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Barnes</strong>, vice president emerita, served on President John Hitt&rsquo;s leadership team from 1994 until her retirement in 2008. She retired as vice president and chief of staff. Barnes began teaching English at UCF, then Florida Technological University, in August 1968, the first semester classes were offered. She took a leave of absence four years later to earn her Ph.D. in British Literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and then she returned to UCF&rsquo;s Department of English. As vice president and chief of staff, Barnes also served as the UCF Board of Trustees&rsquo; associate corporate secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Huddleston</strong>, vice president emeritus, will retire this month as vice president for Marketing, Communications and Admissions, a division that he helped to launch in 2004. Nationally, he is known as a pioneer of enrollment management and as a leader in brand identity and integrated communications and marketing. In 1993, Huddleston arrived as vice provost for Enrollment and Academic Services, and he later served as vice president of Student Development and Enrollment Services During his tenure, UCF&rsquo;s academic reputation has soared and the quality of students has increased dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>Djehane Hosni</strong>, professor emeritus, had a distinguished academic career at UCF as a member of the Department of Economics from 1977 to 2008. She served as the department&rsquo;s chair from 2000 to 2005. Early in her career, she received several research grants that led to a variety of publications and presentations at national and international conferences. She was active in many international projects, including work in the Middle East, and she played a major role in developing UCF&rsquo;s Ph.D. program in Economics. She has been recognized with two Teaching Incentive Program (TIP) awards, as well as an Excellence in Teaching Award from the College of Business Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Yasser Hosni</strong>, professor emeritus, arrived at UCF in 1976 and was instrumental in building the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems. He taught a variety of courses, participated on many committees and earned consistent recognition from UCF and the Institute of Industrial Engineers, where he served as chair from 2001-2002.&nbsp; Hosni taught as a visiting professor at the American University in Cairo and Nile University in Egypt, and he conducted workshops in Egypt, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, and China.</p>
<p><strong>Rosie Joels</strong>, professor emeritus, retired in 2007 after 29 years at UCF&rsquo;s College of Education. She participated in the development of the UCF Elementary Education and Reading Education programs. She taught undergraduate and graduate reading courses in Orlando and at nine off-campus locations. She also provided professional development for faculty, helped graduate students with research projects and won many notable awards, including the nationally recognized Virginia Hamilton Essay Award in 2000 for her article focused on human dignity and social justice.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Phillips</strong>, professor emeritus, was the first engineering director for CREOL, then the Center for Electro Optics and Lasers, when it was formed in 1984. He pursued funding from the Legislature, raising more than $1.5 million and securing 15 faculty positions for the center. Additionally, he was recognized by Gov. Lawton Chiles for his work to develop space education at UCF&rsquo;s Florida Space Institute at Kennedy Space Center. After four research books and more than 130 research papers, he is now retired, but he continues to collaborate with faculty and students and remains active in research.</p>
<p><strong>George Stegeman</strong>, professor emeritus, was the first recipient of the Cobb Family Chair in Optical Sciences and Engineering. His principal interest since he began working at UCF in 1990 has been the study of nonlinear optics in waveguided structures. At CREOL, the College of Optics and Photonics, he established state-of-the-art research labs and attracted federal support for the college until his retirement in 2008. Stegeman received the Hertzberg Medal for Achievement in Physics in 1980 and the UCF Professorial Excellence Program Award and UCF Researcher of the Year honors in 1998.</p>
<p><strong>James Taylor</strong>, professor emeritus, taught in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering and directed the Environmental Systems Engineering Institute for 23 years. He held the Alex Alexander Chair for Environmental Engineering. Taylor raised more than $10 million for nationally and internationally sponsored research. He has co-authored four textbooks and written nearly 230 technical publications. Taylor&rsquo;s 31years of service to UCF ended last year, but his extensive research in drinking water treatment is still highly recognized by his colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Wallace</strong>, professor emeritus, retired in 2007 after a 32-year career at UCF. One of UCF&rsquo;s first Anthropology faculty members, he later studied biobehavioral anthropology and neuroanatomy. His recent publications have culminated in his third book, titled &ldquo;Membrane Microdomain Regulation of Neuron Signaling.&rdquo; He is an interdisciplinary fellow in the Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning. Wallace served as associate chair for the Department of Anthropology, formerly the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, from 2004 until his retirement.</p>
