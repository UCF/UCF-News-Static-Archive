			<p><em>The Knights will face SMU at noon Saturday, Dec. 4, at Bright House Networks Stadium. For ticket information, click <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/tickets/c-usa-champ-tix-info2010.html">here</a>. Students will be admitted free with their UCF ID. The campus will open for&nbsp;game day&nbsp;activities at 8 a.m. Saturday. </em></p>
<p>For a game that lacked much drama, not to mention a lot of sharpness on either side of the football for long stretches, UCF still allowed itself to dream big on this sunny Saturday at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.</p>
<p>Having already locked up a spot in next week's Conference USA title game, UCF went out in the regular-season finale and took care of business against Memphis and continued to carry the belief that if it can keep winning it can be back in the Liberty Bowl again in a month.</p>
<p>UCF used another spectacular day from freshman quarterback Jeff Godfrey and two-touchdown efforts from wide out Jamar Newsome and tailback Latavius Murray to pull away from Memphis 37-17 before a crowd of 14,992.</p>
<p>The victory ensured that the Knights (9-3 overall and 7-1 in Conference USA play) will head into Saturday's Conference USA title game against SMU (7-5 and 6-2) with plenty of positive momentum. UCF has won seven of its last eight games with a home loss against Southern Miss being the only blip since Sept. 25.</p>
<p>Win next Saturday and the Knights could be back in Memphis for the Dec. 31 Liberty Bowl for the second time in school history. Several of UCF's seniors admitted that nothing would be sweeter than ending the season in the same place many of them did in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to lie, I've definitely thought about coming back here to the Liberty Bowl,'' said UCF senior linebacker Derrick Hallman, who recorded his first interception of the season on Saturday. &quot;But I'm extremely excited about going to play next week so we can have that opportunity to play (in another Liberty Bowl).''</p>
<p>The Knights actually secured a spot in next Saturday's Conference USA title game and clinched the East Division crown for a third time in six years the day before when SMU beat East Carolina in overtime and Southern Miss lost to Tulsa. The Knights and Mustangs haven't played since 2008, a UCF 31-17 win. The two teams are slated to meet again next season in Dallas.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some guys running through the hallways (at the team hotel) when we found out we were in the title game, but we knew that we still had to come out and play hard (on Saturday),'' said UCF standout senior defensive end Bruce Miller, who became the school's all-time leader in sacks (32) with two QB drops on Saturday. &quot;Our goal is the conference championship, but it's also to go out and win every game. But there was a sigh of relief knowing we were going to get into that game. We're expecting a full house and a great atmosphere and it's going to be a great game.''</p>
<p>Tickets for the C-USA title game at Bright House Networks Stadium are on sale for $30 at TicketMaster.com, UCFAthletics.com or by calling (407) 823-1000. UCF also hosted the game in 2005 and 2007, losing to Tulsa in 2005 and defeating the Golden Hurricane in 2007.</p>
<p>UCF's nine wins are tied for the second-most in school history, trailing only the 10 in 1990 and 2007. And on Saturday, UCF won its school-record fifth road game of the season. The Knights had never won more than four times away from Orlando before this season.</p>
<p>UCF coach George O'Leary said there was great satisfaction in his team closing out the regular season with a convincing victory even though there was little to play for. O'Leary is also proud that the Knights set a goal before the season of winning the conference title and now they are in position to do just that.</p>
<p>&quot;We came away from here with a good win, a conference win and we secured the Eastern Division. Now, all that is left to do is go play SMU in the conference championship game,'' O'Leary said. &quot;I know our fan base will be excited about it and our players are very excited about it. ... We'll have our hands full and I'm looking forward to playing SMU.''</p>
