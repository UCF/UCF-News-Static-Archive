			<p>The University of Central Florida's
<place w:st="on"></place>
East Orlando campus will be divided into three parking zones on football game days, and drivers are encouraged to follow preferred routes to and from those areas.</p>
<p>About 12,000 parking spots in specially designated zones will be available for the university's first on-campus football game on Sept. 15 and five other home games at Bright House Networks Stadium. Of those spots, about 6,000 are free and open to the public on campus from 7 a.m. until two hours after the game concludes.</p>
<p>UCF also will provide free shuttle services for students who live in nearby apartment complexes; parking areas for RVs; and a drop-off point near the stadium for registered commercial and chartered buses. The university's goal is to take as many vehicles off the roads as possible and minimize the impact of traffic on surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Normal university parking decals/hang tags will not be honored on football game days, except for decals and hang tags for permanently assigned campus residential housing.</p>
<p>Parking is only authorized in designated parking lots and garages. Patrons who illegally park on or along any campus roadways or in other non-designated parking areas are subject to towing and fines.</p>
<p>Gemini Boulevard North will be closed to vehicle traffic from Alafaya Trail to North Orion Boulevard from&nbsp;three hours prior to game time until two hours after the game ends. This road closure is designed to ensure pedestrian safety between the main and north sections of campus.</p>
<p>A committee of university officials began working on a traffic and parking plan late last year. Gameday Management Group was hired to help develop and implement the plan. The firm has extensive experience working with Major League Baseball, the National Football League and NASCAR on many of their special events.</p>
<p>Extensive details about getting to the game, shuttle services and parking can be found at <a href="http://www.ucfgameday.com/">www.ucfgameday.com </a>. Colored maps and directions also are available at the site. A section called A to Z answers most questions that game day participants may have.</p>
<p><strong>Parking and Getting There</strong></p>
<p>Parking is divided into three sections&nbsp;-- Gold, Red and Blue. Preferred<span> </span>directions to campus depend on where you plan to park on the day of the game.</p>
<p>The Gold Zone, closest to Bright House Networks Stadium, requires a reserved game day parking permit and is reserved for members of the Golden Knights Club, credentialed media, stadium operations personnel and students with special permits. Preferred routing to Gold Zone parking (from the south) is via Libra Drive/Gemini Boulevard and (from the north or west) via McCulloch Road/Orion Boulevard.</p>
<p>Only Gold Zone patrons and patrons with disabilities will be authorized to drive on and off campus via Orion Boulevard (north campus<span> </span>entrance accessible from McCulloch Road) from three hours prior to kickoff until two hours after the game ends. That entrance will be open to anyone walking or riding a bicycle onto campus.</p>
<p>The Red Zone is for general parking and official university business. Red Zone lots are located in the south-southwest sector of campus. Parking is free and provided on a first-come, first-served basis unless otherwise designated. However, Garage B is reserved only for official university business on game days, and potential users must pre-register with the Provost's Office.</p>
<p>Preferred routing to Red Zone parking (from the south) is via Alafaya Trail/Central Florida Boulevard and (from the north or west) via Alafaya Trail/University Boulevard.</p>
<p>The Blue Zone is open to everyone. The lots are located in the northwest sector of campus. Parking is free and provided on a first-come, first-served basis unless otherwise designated. Preferred routing to Blue Zone parking is via Alafaya Trail/University Boulevard or Centaurus Drive.</p>
<p>Disabled patrons with proper DMV tags may park in the ground level of Garage D in the Gold Zone. Patrons can ride a shuttle that will take disabled guests from the garage to the stadium. Other parking spots for disabled patrons are available throughout the campus, but shuttle services for patrons with disabilities will only be provided from Garage D.</p>
<p><strong>Shuttle Service for Students</strong></p>
<p>UCF will operate student shuttles buses for all normally serviced apartment complexes (except Tivoli and Northgate due to their close proximity to the stadium) on each home football game day. That means that normal UCF shuttle routes #1 through #9 (except #6) will be operating on game days on a special schedule. Large items such as lawn chairs, tables and large coolers are not allowed on the buses. Students also should check the Game Day Web site for items that are prohibited inside Bright House Networks Stadium.</p>
<p>The shuttles will run from five hours prior to the start of the game until three hours after the game ends. Visit <a href="http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/student-shuttles.html">http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/brighthouse/student-shuttles.html </a>for times and other restrictions.</p>
<p>The on-campus shuttle routes (Black and Gold routes) will not be operating on game days.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Charter Buses</strong></p>
<p>Commercial and charter shuttles will be able to load and unload at the former Winn-Dixie parking lot located at 1680 E. McCulloch Road, the northeast corner of the Lockwood Blvd and McCulloch Road intersection. Special rules apply for charter shuttles also desiring to park during the game, and operators must register with Parking Services at 407-823-2700 prior to 5 p.m. on the Wednesday before each game. UCF is asking other commercial shuttles to register even if they only want to drop-off and pick-up fans.</p>
<p>Shuttles that are not pre-registered with Parking Services may park at the Partnership II lot in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to campus. That lot is located at 3100 Technology Parkway, Orlando.</p>
<p><strong>RV Parking</strong></p>
<p>Overnight RV parking is only allowed in specifically designated parking lots.</p>
<p>Golden Knights Club members with valid Gold Zone RV parking credentials are authorized to park in their designated Gold Zone lot (northeast of Gemini Boulevard) starting at 9 a.m. Friday.</p>
<p>All other fans are authorized to park on a first-come, first-served basis in Lot B7 (Red Zone) between the old Wayne Densch Sports Center and the Center for Multilingual/Multicultural Studies (Barbara Ying Center) starting at 4 p.m. Friday. They are encouraged to register with Parking Services by calling 407-823-2700. The cost is $100 per game or $500 for the season.</p>
<p>Overflow RV parking is authorized in the Research Park at the Partnership II parking lot (3100 Technology Parkway) only after the primary lots are full.</p>
<p>All RV occupants must register with the lot attendant upon arrival and are expected to adhere to all pertinent campus and parking lot regulations and all tailgating guidelines. No servicing support of any type is available on campus, and all RVs must vacate university parking areas by 9 a.m. Sunday.</p>
