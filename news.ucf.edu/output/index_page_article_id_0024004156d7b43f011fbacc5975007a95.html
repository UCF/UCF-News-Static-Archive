			<p>As part of UCF&rsquo;s new Kurdish Political Studies Initiative, the UCF Global Perspectives Office, in partnership with UCF&rsquo;s Learning Institute for Elders (LIFE), hosted a just-concluded Kurdish lecture series. In addition to LIFE sessions, the speakers addressed classes and community groups in Central Florida.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The series was launched on Feb. 3 with a presentation by Michael Gunter, a globally known authority on Kurdish affairs and a professor of Political Science at Tennessee Tech University. His premise was that, for the first time in their modern history, &quot;the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey at least are cautiously ascending.&quot; He explained that this is happening for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, in Northern Iraq, the two U.S.-led wars against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein have had the side effect of helping to create the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). And the KRG has &ldquo;become an island of democratic stability, peace and burgeoning economic progress, as well as an autonomous part of a projected federal, democratic, post-Saddam Iraq,&rdquo; he said. If, however, such a future for Iraq fails to materialize, the KRG is positioned to become independent.</p>
<p>Second, should Turkey be successful in gaining admission to the European Union, that country&rsquo;s ethnic Kurds would obtain their full democratic rights. Gunter pointed out that EU membership for Turkey will not happen soon and that the issue is &ldquo;reaching a crisis point&rdquo; as other matters, including those associated with its Kurdish population, obstruct the path.</p>
<p>Gunter also argued that the &ldquo;main threat to Iraqi Kurds is Baghdad itself.&rdquo; Although the new Iraqi constitution provides meaningful autonomy for Kurds, the prime minister of Iraq, Nuri al-Malaki, wants to re-centralize the nation, which Gunter said represents the number one threat to the KRG. The second threat, according to Gunter, is Turkey itself.</p>
<p>In a more general context, Gunter explained that he is &ldquo;not optimistic that we are going to make the Middle East a bastion of democracy and peace tomorrow.&rdquo; As long as the Middle East has resentment against the West for its historic impositions in those lands and the West holds on to its views of Islam as a barrier to modernity and economic progress, it will be quite difficult to achieve reconciliation. One of the most significant conflicts marking the continuation of this clash, Gunter said, is the presence of the United States in Iraq, a matter that was addressed more specifically by the next speaker in the series.</p>
<p>On Feb. 10, Brendan O&rsquo;Leary, the Lauder Professor of Political Science and director of the Penn Program in Ethnic Conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, shared ideas from his recent book, &ldquo;How to Get Out of Iraq with Integrity.&rdquo; He indicated that it is possible to get out of Iraq honestly, even though some deem that the United States&rsquo; intervention was dishonest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaving in an appropriate manner would mean showing respect for Iraq&rsquo;s constitution and territorial integrity, according to O&rsquo;Leary. He said that the constitution is worth defending because it is a power-sharing settlement for a pluralistic federation. It is, specifically, a &ldquo;free union,&rdquo; recognizing many nationalities, religions and sects. This same reality is also Iraq&rsquo;s challenge. O&rsquo;Leary spoke about the difficulties of building a federal Iraq, with the presence of three powerful and conflicting groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the government becomes dominated by Arabs, Kurds will suffer,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary said. &ldquo;If it is dominated by Shiites, Sunnis will suffer. And if it is dominated by Sunnis, Shiites will suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of his main ideas, and a central point of his book, was that the boundaries of the KRG need to be settled before the United States leaves Iraq. Kirkuk, seen by Kurds as an original part of Kurdistan, is a key point of contention. O&rsquo;Leary said that if the dispute over Kirkuk is not settled as prescribed by the Iraqi constitution, there will be trouble. His suggestion was for the United States to use &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; to create a power-sharing system in Kirkuk. However, this will not be an easy task as it is critical to also gain the support of powerful neighbors, including Iran and Turkey.</p>
<p>Continuing the conversation on Feb. 17, Jonathan Morrow, the senior legal adviser to the Ministry of Natural Resources for the Kurdistan Regional Government, discussed the politics of oil. One of the main controversies surrounding this topic is domestic opposition to foreign investment in Arab-dominated Iraq. This opposition exists despite lower oil prices and the Iraqi government&rsquo;s budget deficit, a situation that makes it difficult to refuse foreign participation.</p>
<p>In the KRG, though, a different perspective prevails. According to Morrow, &ldquo;the average Kurd is in favor of foreign investment.&rdquo; Morrow argued that the Kurds provide the major incentive for Baghdad to start making policy concerning its own oil provisions. The Kurds have always sought oil autonomy, using it as more of a self-protection strategy than anything else. Morrow said that the &ldquo;alarmism&rdquo; created by those believing the Kurds are ready to fight for an independent country &ldquo;is not justified.&rdquo; Asked whether the Kurds have alternative economic-development options, Morrow suggested minerals, farming, and widespread fruit and vegetable production, but concluded by saying that &ldquo;if the oil sector stopped, the economy would plunge into chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, in an effort to glance into the future and discuss possibilities for the Kurds and Iraq, retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner spoke on Feb. 24. Garner, the former director of the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance for Post-War Iraq, gave his thoughts on the Kurdish situation in Iraq and provided two views.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, in a &ldquo;half-full-glass assessment,&rdquo; he described the KRG as the &ldquo;other&rdquo; Iraq in that it has a fully functioning, representative democracy that supports tolerance, women&rsquo;s rights and human rights; has the ability to supply a substantial part of the world&rsquo;s oil needs; and is extremely pro-American. Garner also pointed out that, &ldquo;since 1991, there has not been one U.S. soldier killed, wounded or kidnapped within the boundaries of the KRG.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Garner noted, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s dynamic growth everywhere. New schools. New universities. New hotels. New police academies. New houses, soccer complexes, amusement parks, hospitals. It&rsquo;s amazing the amount of growth that&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in a &ldquo;half-empty-glass assessment,&rdquo; Garner pointed out the lingering problems over disputed territories, most notably in Kirkuk, which largely revolves around access to oil revenue; the lack of a clear U.S. policy on the Kurds in Iraq; the recent provincial elections in Iraq and their potential for strengthening a Shiite bloc substantially influenced by Iran; and concerns with Iraq&rsquo;s strong northern neighbor, Turkey.&nbsp; All of these are serious problems, especially the Arab-Kurd disputed territories in and around Kirkuk, which Garner &ndash; echoing O&rsquo;Leary &ndash; said the United States must help resolve before it pulls out of Iraq. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Garner argued that a clear U.S. policy on the Kurds would help resolve all of these issues. He suggested placing an official U.S. &ldquo;face&rdquo; in the Kurdistan region of Iraq via a U.S. consulate.&nbsp; He noted that putting a consulate inside the KRG &ldquo;would go a long way towards resolving many of the issues that we have in that area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the UCF Global Perspectives Office and UCF LIFE, the Kurdish lecture series was sponsored by the UCF Political Science Department, UCF Kurdish Political Studies Initiative, UCF Middle Eastern Studies Program, UCF Diplomacy Program and the Global Connections Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
