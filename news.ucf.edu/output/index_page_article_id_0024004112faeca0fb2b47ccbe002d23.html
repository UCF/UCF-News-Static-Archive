			<p>Florida should raise tuition to the national average, make Bright Futures more of a merit-based program and increase need-based financial aid to improve the quality of state universities and ensure that low-income students can attend them, the Florida Council of 100 told the state Board of Governors during its meeting Thursday at UCF.</p><p>In a presentation titled, &quot;We Must Do Better: Moving Floridas State University System to the Next Level in Quality and Accessibility,&quot; Joe Heel, a member of the councils Higher Education Funding Task Force, said Florida produces fewer college graduates than other states at a higher cost per student. At the same time, the state spends much less than the national average on need-based aid.</p><p>Florida spends $1 million for every 25.1 students who graduate, compared with the national average of $1 million for every 29. 4 graduates. The states universities also receive $14,900 per student, which is less than the national average of $16,600.</p><p>&quot;The Council of 100 says weve got a problem and we have to solve it,&quot; said board member Peter Rummell. &quot;Heres a solution; its not the only one.&quot;</p><p>The Council of 100, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group of Florida business leaders, worked with McKinsey &amp; Co. and the Council for Educational Policy Research and Improvement to develop the proposal, which the Council of 100 says could help produce 4,500 more bachelors degrees each year.</p><p>Under the proposal, the state would continue to spend $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion a year on higher education. Universities would collect more money by increasing tuition and fees 13.9 percent each year over the next five years to meet the national average. The added money would allow schools to spend more on students and increase need-based aid, according to the proposal.</p><p>Other recommendations include:</p><p>* Making Bright Futures scholarships more merit-based by increasing the minimum SAT requirements from 970 to 1070.</p><p>* Redirecting $366 million freed up by its Bright Futures proposal and others measures to boost spending per student by 14 percent by 2008-09.</p><p>* Increasing need-based aid from $80 million to $243 million by 2008-09 to improve access for students from low-income families.</p><p>* Accruing $101 million each year beginning in 2005-06 to ensure that all current pre-paid contracts remain viable, and changing new contracts to include tuition increases.</p><p>The Board of Governors, which oversees the state university system, met Wednesday and Thursday at the UCF Student Union.</p><p>On Thursday, Chairwoman Carolyn Roberts thanked UCF President John Hitt and UCF Board of Trustees Chairman Dick Nunis for hosting the meeting and honored the university with a proclamation recognizing the universitys 40th anniversary and its academic and research accomplishments.</p><p>Hitt said UCF and the Board of Governors have worked well together and needed to continue doing so as Floridas higher education demands grow and funding tightens. &quot;We really need your leadership and advocacy more then ever,&quot; Hitt told the board.</p><p>On Wednesday, board committee members heard presentations about how there is a need for more physicians in Florida and how that need could be met by expanding or adding medical schools. UCF and Florida International University are interested in opening medical schools.</p><p>The board committee agreed to ask staff to build a &quot;model&quot; to determine the need and whether it should be addressed by building new schools.</p><p>Following current trends, there will be a nationwide physician shortage of about 20 percent, or 200,000 doctors, within the next 20 years, said Dr. Richard Cooper, director of the Health Policy Institute at the Medical College of Wisconsin.</p><p>With nearly 49,000 doctors, Florida ranks 17th nationally in the number of doctors it has per 100,000 people, dropping from 11th just four years ago, according to the American Medical Association. But the bigger problem may be the shrinking number of medical residency opportunities in Florida, said Dr. Mathis Becker, chairman of the state Department of Healths Graduate Medical Education Committee. Florida ranks 45th among states in the number of medical residents per 100,000 people, Becker said.</p><p>Florida would have to add about 2,000 residency positions funded by the state over the next five years to meet the national average, Becker said. Several experts told the board that doctors are more likely to practice in the state in which they serve their residencies.</p><p>Central Floridas medical community has outlined a need for a medical school in Orlando, Hitt told the board, adding that many experts have pointed out that Orlando is the largest metropolitan area without such a school.</p><p>UCFs Board of Trustees in November approved conducting a feasibility study for building a medical school. The university is in the process of selecting a firm to conduct that study.</p><p>UCF now participates in an accelerated medical school program with the University of South Floridas College of Medicine that allows students to earn a UCF bachelors degree and a USF medical degree in seven years. USF, Florida State University and the University of Florida are the public universities in the state that have medical schools.</p><p>The next Board of Governors meeting is scheduled for April 22 at Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee.
