			<p>Eight University of Central Florida professors were awarded emeritus status Wednesday, April 4, at the annual Founders' Day ceremony.</p>
<p>Emeritus professors have worked at the university for at least five years, and they have retired or are retiring this year. Emeritus status grants them a lifetime link to UCF and honors the major professional contributions and distinction that they achieved in their careers at the university.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hynes</strong>, professor emeritus, will retire this year after 36 years on the education faculty at UCF. Hynes, who won the esteemed Pegasus Professor award in 2005, has published 33 books and 80 journal articles and received more than $5 million in research grants. Hynes won the University Researcher of the Year award in 1993 and the College of Education's Excellence in Research Award in 1982 and 1991. He also won the college's Excellence in Teaching Award in 1985. Hynes founded the Lockheed Martin Academy for Mathematics and Science at UCF.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph Llewellyn</strong>, professor emeritus, came to UCF as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1980. He has worked as a professor of physics and served most recently as interim chair of Physics. He won two Teaching Incentive Program awards and a College Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award. His research in nuclear and environmental physics led to more than $500,000 in research funding and 70 scientific publications.</p>
<p><strong>Linda Malone</strong>, professor emeritus, has served as a statistics and engineering professor at UCF since 1979. She taught for the past 13 years in the Department of Industrial and Management Systems, and she served as that department's graduate coordinator and advisor from 1996 to 2003. Malone chaired the Department of Statistics from 1985 to 1989 and chaired the Faculty Senate from 1985 to 1987. Top science and engineering journals have published more than 60 of her articles. She also is credited with helping to recruit many female students into engineering and science majors at UCF.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Morgan</strong>, professor emeritus, has been on the faculty in the Psychology Department since 1987 and has also served as associate dean for the College of Arts and Sciences and associate dean of Graduate Studies. His research in the field of human factors has led to more than 50 journal articles and book chapters. He also has 50 technical reports and 137 professional presentations to his name. Included in his many honors is the Franklin V. Taylor Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Engineering Psychology, which was awarded by the American Psychological Association in 1997.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Rubin</strong>, professor emeritus, will retire in December after 35 years at UCF.&nbsp; He started in the Department of Marketing in 1972 and has served as department chair and as director of the Small Business Development Center. Rubin has taught 17 undergraduate and graduate courses and has earned three Teaching Incentive Program awards at UCF.&nbsp; Rubin also has contributed his expertise to the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, the Better Business Bureau and the Orlando Regional Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Frances Blackwell Smith</strong>, professor emeritus, has been involved in the UCF School of Nursing since its inception in 1979 and has been a leader in nursing education throughout her career. Her specialty is in the area of psychiatric mental health. She served six terms on the Faculty Senate and was on the UCF Accreditation Self Study committee for three years. She has contributed to the Florida Nurses Association, serving as conference leader for the annual Clinical Excellence Conference entitled &quot;Nurses Who Make a Difference.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Michael J. Sweeney</strong>, professor emeritus, contributed greatly to the development of the Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, as well as the College of Health and Public Affairs. Sweeney has taught 14 courses in fields such as immunology, serology and quantitative biological methods. He earned more than $600,000 in research grants and was the 1991 Researcher of the Year in the College of Health and Public Affairs. He also received the 1990 College of Arts and Sciences Teacher of the Year award and a Teaching Incentive Program award in 1993.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Wolf</strong>, professor emeritus, retired four years ago after joining the UCF faculty in 1972. He designed many of the Department of Music's core courses and was the recipient of College Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Awards in 1980 and 1984, as well as a Teaching Incentive Program award in 1994. In 1998, he received the University Excellence in Professional Service Award. Wolf has served as president of the State of Florida Music Teachers Association. At UCF, he performed as a solo piano recitalist, a chamber musician and an orchestra soloist across the United States and overseas.<br />
