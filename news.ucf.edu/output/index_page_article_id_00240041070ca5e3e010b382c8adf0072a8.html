			<p>The avian flu remains a distant threat for now, but local health officials and community leaders are stressing the importance of preparing for a potential outbreak that could dramatically impact businesses, schools and families. </p><p>At a half-day symposium Tuesday hosted by the <place /><placetype />University</placetype /> of <placename />Central Florida</placename /></place />s <place /><placename />Metropolitan</placename /> <placetype />Center</placetype /></place /> for Regional Studies, presenters urged families to stock up on food and learn how to give basic medical care because hospitals may be overloaded. They also said businesses need to plan for operating with two-thirds of their usual staffs and for finding alternative suppliers for key goods and services. </p><p>While the current strain of avian flu may never be detected in the United States, preparations that families and businesses undertake also would be useful for hurricanes, future flu pandemics or other disasters, several presenters noted. </p><p>We need to look at this as a broad opportunity to prepare for catastrophes of any kind, said Joel Haas, chief executive officer of the American Red Cross of Central Florida. </p><p>About 150 people attended the forum at the <place /><placename />Fairwinds</placename /> <placename />Alumni</placename /> <placetype />Center</placetype /></place />. UCF hosted the forum to help the community become more aware of the avian flu and how they can prepare for a potential outbreak of a virus that would spread more easily than seasonal flu and lead to more illnesses because people would have less immunity. </p><p>UCF speakers included Dr. Michael Deichen, associate director of clinical services for Health Services; and Elliot Vittes, an expert on epidemics who also is the director of the Office of Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies; and Melvin Rogers, assistant dean of the College of Health and Public Affairs.</p><p><span>Deichen described how UCF employees are working together to determine how to best care for ill students and to keep essential campus operations running even if classes are canceled. UCF also is planning to hold a vaccination drill in August. For more information on UCFs preparations, read <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=00240041070ca5e3e010b382c8adf0072ad&amp;mode=news">this story</a>.</span> </p><p>David Winn, the Middle East/North Africa specialist on the U.S. Department of States Avian Influenza Action Group, provided an international perspective on a virus that has killed 128 people. Winn said there have been 227 reported cases of avian flu but that its impossible to know how many cases there are worldwide because many are unreported.</p><p>Winn said the United States is working with the World Health Organization and United Nations to help prevent the spread of the avian flu as much as possible. Early detection of the disease and intervention in those countries are critical to achieve that goal, he said. </p><p>The current strain of avian flu has been detected in birds in 51 countries, up from 14 just five months ago, Winn said. However, the disease has not shown that it can spread easily from person to person, which would be necessary for a pandemic to occur. </p><p>James Pate, emergency operations manager for the Orange County Health Department, said the state is stockpiling gloves, masks and Tamiflu vaccine for emergency responders. While the vaccine is only partially effective, it could help to delay the onset of a pandemic in the state, and a delay would allow more time for a better vaccine to become available, Pate said. </p><p>The biggest issue is education, Pate said. If you just convince two people that they have to wash their hands and stay home when theyre sick, then wed have accomplished our mission today  We could virtually eliminate diseases in the state of Florida and the United States if people just washed their hands. </p><p>In addition to washing their hands frequently and long enough, people should cover their mouths when they cough with their arms and not their hands to help prevent diseases, said Dr. Kevin Sherin, director of the Orange County Health Department. </p><p>Sherin also said that even if there isnt a pandemic flu outbreak in Central Florida, a few cases could cause significant disruptions for businesses because many parents would keep their children out of school and stay home with them instead of going to work. </p><p>Speakers on the second panel included Mike Ganio, senior manager of security compliance and training for Orange County Public Schools; George DeLong, vice president of support services at Orlando Regional Health Care; and George Williams, vice president of government and environmental affairs at Darden Restaurants. </p><p>Ganio said the school district, the 12<sup>th</sup> largest in the nation, could provide shelter space and allow its buses to be used in an emergency situation. The district is examining how classes could be continued if schools were to be closed because of the avian flu, he said. </p><p>DeLong said the biggest concern for hospitals is dealing with a surge in patients, especially those who need intensive care and ventilators. Another concern is how to ensure that employees will be willing to come to work if they believe there is a risk that they could catch the disease from patients and spread it to their families, DeLong said. </p><p>Sponsors of the forum included the College of Health and Public Affairs, Community Relations, the Global Perspectives Office and Learning Institute for Elders at UCF. Sponsors also include the African American Chamber of Commerce of Central Florida, East Orlando Chamber of Commerce, Global Connections Foundation, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Orlando and the Greater Oviedo Chamber of Commerce.</p>
