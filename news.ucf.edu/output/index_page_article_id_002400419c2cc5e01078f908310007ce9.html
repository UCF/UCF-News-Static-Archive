			<p>University of Central Florida President John Hitt called upon the Board of Governors Thursday to establish a medical college in Orlando that would help address a critical doctor shortage, improve health care and pump billions of dollars into the economy.</p><p>Joined by dozens of Central Florida government and community leaders who traveled to Jacksonville for the meeting, Hitt outlined a desperate need for more medical education in Florida and how UCF was well-prepared to take on that mission. He followed a presentation on a similar proposal from Florida International University.</p><p>As leaders of our state university system, you have before you a rare opportunity, Hitt told the board. This afternoon, you have heard (FIU) President (Modesto) Maidique and me, along with key leaders from our communities, lay before you strong, fact-based cases for the need for two new medical colleges in Florida.<br /> <br />Board Chair Carolyn Roberts announced at the beginning of the meeting held at the University of North Florida that the board, which oversees the states 11 universities, would vote on the proposals from UCF and FIU no later than its March 23 meeting.</p><p>A UCF medical college and its medical degree program would capitalize on the universitys strengths in biomedical sciences, modeling and simulation, and optics and photonics while fulfilling the states need for more physicians.</p><p>If approved by the state, the college would be established in fall 2006. The degree calls for a four-year curriculum that begins clinical education in fall 2008 and would produce about 120 medical graduates each year. Students also would have opportunities to study at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine and to participate in shared research programs.</p><p>Two of the largest medical systems in the country, Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare, would partner with UCF to support the medical college. The hospitals have agreed to establish 95 new medical residencies immediately. Most medical students who study and complete their residencies in Florida stay in the state.</p><p>The hospitals also would pay 40 percent of the salaries for 50 clinical faculty members provide support staff and clinical and office space, all of which would reduce the cost to the state for operating the medical college.</p><p>UCF would cover the initial capital costs for the medical college building and library with private donations. As of Thursday, the university had raised $31.9 million, most of which is eligible for state matching funds that would increase the total to $62.4 million.</p><p>Working in association with strong hospital partners, we are clearly ready to meet the challenge of developing the two high-quality, research-based medical schools our state needs, and to do so with private donors bearing at least half the capital costs of the buildings and equipment needed, Hitt said.</p><p>Florida needs at least two more medical schools to address the growing demand for doctors in the state, according to a study by MGT of America. The annual need for new physicians in Florida is expected to grow from 2,800 in 2003 to 4,200 in 2021.</p><p>A medical college in Orlando, the largest metropolitan area in the country without such a school, would help improve health care in Central Florida and inject millions of dollars into the area economy, according to several studies. Other medical schools in the state average more than $2.7 billion each in annual economic impact.</p><p>Pointing to such benefits, Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer joined about a dozen Central Florida leaders who spoke to the board Thursday in favor of establishing the medical college in Orlando.</p><p>State Rep. Dean Cannon of Winter Park assured the board that if it approved establishing both medical colleges the Legislature would fund them without affecting funding for other universities. Cannon said he had never seen such broad and overwhelming support for any other project. We are clearly ready, Cannon said.</p><p>In early October, Tavistock Group, a private investment company that owns the Lake Nona and Isleworth communities, pledged $12.5 million in cash and 50 acres of land valued at more than $8 million to establish the UCF Healthcare Campus at Lake Nona, where the medical college would be located if it is approved.</p><p>To date, 15 corporations, organizations, individuals and others have stepped up with donations of $1 million or more each and will be named founders of the medical college if it is approved. They are:</p><p>-- Tavistock Group, $12.5 million, 50 acres of land<br />-- Alan and Harriet Ginsburg Family Foundation, $4 million<br />-- Broad Street Partners found Steve Walsh and his wife, Paula, $2.5 million<br />-- Florida Hospital, $1 million<br />-- Orlando Regional Healthcare, $1 million<br />-- Avalon Park developer Beat Kahli and his wife, Jill, $1 million<br />-- The Martin Andersen-Gracia Andersen Foundation, $ 1 million<br />-- UCF Board of Trustees Chair Dick Nunis and his wife, Mary, $1 million<br />-- The Winter Park Health Foundation, $1 million<br />-- Bank of America, $1 million<br />-- The Elizabeth Morse Genius Foundation, $1 million<br />-- Hughes Supply, $1 million<br />-- Darden Restaurants Chairman Joe Lee, $1 million<br />-- Dynetech Corp. founder Larry Pino and his wife, Janet, $1 million<br />-- Orange County, $1 million; will also match up to $1 million from area governments.</p><p>In addition, an anonymous donor has given $500,000, and Osceola and Seminole counties have pledged $100,000 each toward Orange Countys challenge.</p><p>Last year, Al and Nancy Burnett donated $10 million that in part will be used with state matching and construction funds to pay for the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences building, which would be located with the medical college if it is approved. The biomedical sciences college has been established and will be built regardless of the decision on the medical college.</p><p><a href="http://news2.ucf.edu/files/ucf_med_school_exsummary.pdf">Medical College Proposal -- Executive Summary</a></p><p><a href="http://news2.ucf.edu/files/UCF_Medical_School.pdf.zip">Medical College Proposal</a> (35 mb Zip file download)</p>
