			<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn.&nbsp;&ndash; As a University of Central Florida student, Victor Collazo watched the school&rsquo;s first football game 28 years ago &ldquo;knee deep in mud and water,&rdquo; and he has attended almost every home game since then.</p>
<p>After following the team through so many good and tough times, Collazo enjoyed traveling to Memphis this weekend to watch the Knights face Mississippi State in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl, their biggest bowl game ever.</p>
<p>While the Knights lost 10-3, Collazo and about 10,000 other UCF fans still experienced a festive weekend with old and new friends and made their cheers heard over the cowbell-ringing Mississippi State fans who made up most of the Liberty Bowl-record crowd of 63,816.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here from day one, just waiting for this day,&rdquo; Collazo said while tailgating with his wife, Jacqui, and friends before the game. &ldquo;We said back in the 1980s that one day, we will get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Liberty Bowl capped a 10-4 season that featured many milestones and records for the Knights. For the first time, the team played its home games on campus in the new Bright House Networks Stadium, part of the changing face of the north end of UCF&rsquo;s campus.</p>
<p>UCF won its first-ever Conference USA title by beating Tulsa at home four weeks ago. And junior running back Kevin Smith rushed for 2,567 yards, a school record and the second-highest total ever for a running back in the nation.</p>
<p>Smith has said he will return for his senior season, and that is one of many reasons why Knights fans are hopeful that trips to major bowl games will become a regular event over the holidays. At the post-game press conference, senior defensive tackle Keith Shologan also expressed optimism about the team&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the younger players are good, and we have a good group of them coming back,&rdquo; said Shologan, who was involved in eight tackles, including two for losses. &ldquo;They just have to come back and work hard in the off-season. They have a good group of coaches to teach them the right fundamentals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s pre-game festivities featured a barbecue where the UCF Marching Knights and Mississippi State&rsquo;s &ldquo;Famous Maroon Band&rdquo; performed. On Friday, UCF fans flocked to the Liberty Bowl parade on Beale Street and jammed a blues club there for a pre-game party organized by the UCF Alumni Association. Many fans and the UCF cheerleaders also visited Graceland while in Memphis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a ball; the kids had a great time,&rdquo; said Ron Ellis, director of the 300-member Marching Knights. &ldquo;It was really important that they could experience what a bowl trip is like. It&rsquo;s something that the university earned and these kids earned, and this will stay with us for a few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many students, whose strong support helped the football team all season, made the 12- to 14-hour drive to Memphis. That group included Megan Stoorza, a graduate student in Criminal Justice, who said she and 11 friends arrived in Memphis at 4 a.m. Saturday and got little sleep before heading to the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had decided that if there was a bowl game in the continental U.S., then we were going to the game,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Stoorza and her friends, including 2007 UCF graduate Candace Meals and 2006 graduate Jenn Bradley, were among the many Knights fans loudly chanting &ldquo;UCF&rdquo; and the Knights&rsquo; fight song before the game.</p>
<p>UCF fans had the most to cheer about early during the game. The Knights recorded the game&rsquo;s first turnover when Johnell Neal picked off Bulldogs quarterback Wesley Carroll late in the first quarter. And UCF scored the game&rsquo;s first points on a 45-yard field goal by Michael Torres early in the second quarter.</p>
<p>At halftime, the game was tied 3-3 and dominated by the defenses. The teams had combined for 13 punts, and UCF had limited Carroll to just 15 yards passing.</p>
<p>Mississippi State scored the game&rsquo;s only touchdown with 1:54 remaining and then held the Knights without a first down on their final possession.</p>
<p>While fans were hoping for a win, the loss won&rsquo;t dampen the enthusiasm that they share for a football program that is clearly on the rise. The Knights have played in two bowl games in the past three seasons, and they set a school record by winning seven straight games this year.</p>
<p>Fans will be ready to pack Bright House Networks Stadium and Memory Mall again next year. And Collazo,&nbsp;a loyal fan ever since he&nbsp;braved the rain and mud in that inaugural victory in 1979, surely will be among them.</p>

<p><strong>Liberty Bowl Notes:</strong></p>
<p>-- Kevin Smith was named UCF's Outstanding Offensive Player of the game. He rushed for 119 yards. Sha'reff Rashad, who recorded nine tackles and a sack, was named the Knights' Outstanding Defensive Player.</p>
<p>-- In addition to the UCF and Mississippi State bands, the halftime show featured Taylor Hicks of American Idol fame.</p>
<p>-- Knights fans aren&rsquo;t used to wearing gloves, but some donned them on Saturday, as the temperature at kickoff was just 44 degrees. It had dropped into the 30s by the second half.</p>
