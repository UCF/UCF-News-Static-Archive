			<p>Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare -- two of the countrys largest hospital systems -- gave the University of Central Florida a combined $2 million to support efforts to build a medical college in Orlando, the university announced Wednesday.</p><p>The donations came on top of the hospitals commitment to partner with the proposed medical college to provide clinical and office space, medical residencies and partial funding for clinical faculty salaries.</p><p>The tremendous generosity and support of Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare clearly demonstrate their commitment to providing more opportunities for medical education and to improving health care in Central Florida and throughout the state, UCF President John Hitt said.</p><p>The hospitals donations and others from the community will bolster UCFs case as it seeks state approval to establish the medical college. So far, UCF has raised a total of $23.5 million, almost all of which is eligible for state matching funds, to build the medical college. </p><p>UCF also announced Wednesday that the Maitland-based Alan and Harriet Ginsburg Family Foundation Inc. has donated $4 million to support the proposed medical college. The university will name the college library in the foundations honor.</p><p>UCF will present its formal proposal to the state Board of Governors, which oversees Floridas 11 public universities, at the boards Nov. 17 meeting in Jacksonville. Florida International University is also requesting a medical college.</p><p>As Florida Hospital expands and plans for our future, the supply of physicians is a critical component in providing quality health care for the Central Florida community, Florida Hospital President Dr. Don Jernigan said. It is our hope that by working with the University of Central Florida, we can provide the community with a leading medical school, which will ultimately give us more physicians, medical students and medical research, as well as facilitate the creation of Orlando as a health destination site.</p><p>The state of Florida needs more doctors, said John Hillenmeyer, president and CEO of Orlando Regional Healthcare. An investment in a medical school would be a first step toward a comprehensive solution, including more graduate medical education at the teaching hospitals.</p><p>Earlier this month, Tavistock Group, a private investment company that owns Lake Nona and Isleworth, pledged $12.5 million in cash and 50 acres of land valued at more than $8 million to establish the UCF Healthcare Campus at Lake Nona, where the medical college would be located if it is approved. (<a href="index?page=article&amp;id=002400414b7bd579010692fefcde00788e&amp;mode=news">Read the full story.</a>)</p><p>Tavistock challenged the community to match its pledge with another $12.5 million. Combined with a dollar-for-dollar state match, the Tavistock gift and community challenge donations could result in $50 million that would be used to pay for the college building and library.</p><p>So far, seven corporations, organizations and couples who will be named founders of the college, including Florida Hospital, Orlando Regional Healthcare and the Alan and Harriet Ginsburg Family Foundation Inc., have stepped up with $1 million or more each for a total of $10 million toward the challenge match. The other donors are Avalon Park developer Beat Kahli and his wife, Jill; The Martin Andersen-Gracia Andersen Foundation Inc.; UCF Board of Trustees Chair Dick Nunis and his wife, Mary; and The Winter Park Health Foundation.</p><p>In addition, Orange County has pledged $1 million and will match up to another $1 million of grants provided by the other 10 counties in UCFs service area for a possible total of $3 million. The public funds are not eligible for a state match. (<a href="index?page=article&amp;id=002400414b7bd579010692fefcde007337&amp;mode=news">Read the full story.</a>)</p><p>Last year, Al and Nancy Burnett donated $10 million that in part will be used with state matching and construction funds to pay for the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences building, which would be located with the medical college if it is approved.</p><p>The UCF medical college and its degree would capitalize on the universitys strengths in biomedical sciences, modeling and simulation, and optics and photonics while fulfilling the communitys need for more physicians, according to the universitys proposal.</p><p>If approved by the state, the college would be established in fall 2006. The degree calls for a four-year curriculum that begins clinical education in fall 2008 and would produce about 120 medical graduates each year.</p><p>Florida needs at least two more medical schools to address the growing demand for doctors in the state, according to a study by MGT of America. The annual need for new physicians in Florida is expected to grow from 2,800 in 2003 to 4,200 in 2021.</p><p>A medical college in Orlando, the largest metropolitan area in the country without such a school, would improve health care in Central Florida and inject millions of dollars into the area economy, according to several studies. Other medical schools in the state average more than $2.7 billion each in annual economic impact.</p>
