			<p>The University of Central Florida informed faculty and staff today that, due to reductions in state funding, the university is reducing college and division budgets. Additionally, the university will begin considering the elimination of some academic and administrative programs and activities.</p>
<p>These actions are designed to ensure that the programs and activities that are most crucial to the success of students and the university are adequately supported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;State-mandated budget reductions have impacted every aspect of how we teach students, conduct research and operate our university,&rdquo; said UCF Provost and Executive Vice President Terry Hickey. &ldquo;To this point, our proactive approach to budget reductions helped us avoid the measures taken by fellow state universities. However, we must face the fact that revenue projections and long-range economic forecasts hold little hope for economic recovery until some time in 2010.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Including the state-mandated 4 percent reduction that took effect July 1, UCF has lost almost $40 million in state support since July 1, 2007. This reduction represents 13.5 percent of the general revenue and lottery funds included in the original fiscal year 2007-08 budget.</p>
<p><b>Budget Reduction</b></p>
<p>On June 12, the state notified agencies of a one percent per quarter reduction in state funds, starting July 1. Maintained over the fiscal year, this will be a 4 percent reduction that will drain $10.9 million from UCF&rsquo;s 2008-09 budget.</p>
<p>Because of a conservative approach to spending, UCF has $4.9 million set aside to address reductions for this fiscal year. That still leaves $6 million the university must cut, with the distinct possibility that our budget will be reduced again if the economy continues to decline.</p>
<p>Therefore, college and division budget allocations for this fiscal year are being reduced by $11.4 million, effective July 1. The resulting funds will be used to cover the $6 million shortfall and create a $5.4 million reserve fund that will be used to manage additional budget cuts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Programs and Activities</b></p>
<p>Because of the difficult economic conditions, UCF is now forced to take steps to ensure that the programs and activities that are most crucial to the success of our students and university are adequately supported. Unfortunately, those steps will likely involve the elimination of some academic and administrative programs and activities.</p>
<p>UCF college deans and division vice presidents will be responsible for evaluating their areas and making recommendations of eliminations, if any. Each college and division will be allowed to keep 70 percent of the funds made available through the elimination of programs or activities.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of the funds resulting from the elimination of programs and activities will be used to support university-wide initiatives that are crucial to student success. Examples include, but are not limited to, library acquisitions and hours of operation and course availability in areas of very high student demand.</p>
<p>Each proposal for program elimination will be thoroughly and seriously considered, and will take into account:</p>
<p>-- The impact on student credit hour production<br />
-- The impact on currently enrolled students and the way in which that impact would be addressed<br />
-- The resulting reduction in personnel and the way in which it would be handled</p>
<p>UCF hopes to have recommendations made and decisions approved this fall.</p>
<p><b>&lsquo;Silent Reductions&rsquo; in Personnel</b></p>
<p>Until now, the university&rsquo;s proactive and fiscally conservative approach has afforded colleges and divisions time and flexibility to respond to state-imposed budget reductions. As a result, the impact of budget cuts on UCF may not have been obvious to those outside the university.</p>
<p>However, UCF has experienced a significant -- albeit silent -- reduction in force. State-mandated budget cuts have eliminated funding for 73 faculty positions and more than two dozen staff positions. Beyond these positions that have been lost to budget cuts, an additional 68 faculty positions and 141 staff positions remain unfilled.</p>
<p>While state funding has decreased, student demand has not. Throughout the years, UCF has become an institution of choice, as recently evidenced by the more than 26,000 first-time-in-college applications received for summer and fall. While the demand to enroll is high, diminishing state funding makes it increasingly difficult to serve all those who wish to enroll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During these difficult times, UCF&rsquo;s faculty and staff have made tremendous efforts to maintain our level of excellence and, clearly, our students are better off for their sacrifices and contributions,&rdquo; Hickey said. &ldquo;The talented and dedicated people who work at UCF are our greatest asset, and we have done all we can to protect those who have helped the university achieve its many successes. I regret that economic circumstances are forcing these decisions.&rdquo;</p>
