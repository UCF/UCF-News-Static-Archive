			  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A University of Central   Florida speech expert has diagnosed an extremely rare disorder in a Sarasota   woman that caused her to speak with a British accent after she suffered a   stroke.</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The case of Foreign Accent   Syndrome  a disorder linked to stroke-related or other internal brain injuries   that leaves affected people with a foreign-sounding accent  is one of fewer   than 20 reported worldwide since 1919, according to Jack Ryalls, professor of   communicative disorders at UCF.</font></p>  
		
	
		
			<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In November 1999,   57-year-old Judi Roberts of Sarasota suffered a stroke that left the right side   of her body paralyzed. She was also unable to speak. After months of physical   therapy, she was no longer paralyzed and was able to speak with some difficulty.   Her speech gradually improved during the next year until she was speaking with   the same fluency as she had before the stroke. However, instead of the familiar   New York accent she once had, she spoke with a British accent. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roberts had never traveled   to Britain. She didnt recognize her own voice. Her friends and family didnt   understand it, and strangers constantly asked her where she was from. One doctor   told her she was not working hard enough to get her old voice back. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At times I thought I was   losing my mind,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;Without the support of my internist and   therapist, I wouldnt have been able to cope.&quot; </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This year, four years after   her stroke, she received an e-mail from a friend who found a New York Times   article about research on language problems conducted by Jennifer Gurd, a   professor at Oxford University in England. &quot;When I read the article I realized   there was a chance I had a legitimate medical problem,&quot; Roberts recalled, &quot;and   that it had a name  Foreign Accent Syndrome.&quot; </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roberts contacted Gurd, who   referred her to UCFs Ryalls, an expert on neurologically based speech and   language disorders who had previously studied the syndrome. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ryalls invited Roberts to   UCF and conducted several language tests designed especially for her. He checked   her ability to change word stress patterns and accentuation by having her   pronounce sentences like, &quot;I wanted to record the record onto a cassette tape.&quot;   He also had her repeat words stressing the wrong syllable in sentences like,   &quot;Put the emPHAsis on the wrong sylLABle.&quot; </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tests enabled Ryalls to   analyze Robertss speech prosody, or the ability to use the appropriate syllable   emphasis, and accentuation, which differs in British and American English. He   wanted to determine if she was applying the wrong syllable stress as part of her   accent.</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After Ryalls initial exams,   Janet Whiteside, an adult neurological disorder specialist at UCF, conducted   other standardized tests for language and cognitive functions in the   universitys Communicative Disorders Clinic.</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on the test results,   Ryalls diagnosed Robertss mysterious acquisition of a British accent as Foreign   Accent Syndrome. He has submitted a report of her case for publication in a   professional journal.</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first widely known case   of Foreign Accent Syndrome reported in English was in 1941, when a Norwegian   woman suffered a brain injury after shrapnel hit her head during World War II.   She experienced severe language problems but eventually recovered, speaking with   a perceived German accent. Her community later ostracized her.</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ryalls said his research on   this and other cases, including Robertss, suggests the syndrome is associated   with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, where language processing   occurs.</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ryalls said Roberts   developed unique ways to cope with her new voice. &quot;She began to respond to   peoples constant questions about where in England she was from by asking,   Where do you think Im from?&quot; Regardless of the city named, Roberts would say   the person was right. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In some ways, her response   showed she was beginning to accept the accent,&quot; Ryalls said. &quot;It was an   ingenious coping mechanism, but it also reveals that she had begun to resign   herself to the change in her speech.&quot;</font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although she started to cope   with her accent, she avoided most social contact and eventually developed   agoraphobia, a fear of open spaces. Roberts even started using a pseudonym,   Tiffany Noell, because she was concerned about embarrassing her family. &quot;She   suffered greatly from some particularly unsympathetic people who did not   understand her changed voice,&quot; Ryalls said. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roberts said she wants   people to know about this strange syndrome that can result from a stroke and   hopes she can spare others the same alienation and misunderstanding she   suffered. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If I can bring notice to   this condition, especially within the medical community, doctors may be able to   help others who find themselves in my situation,&quot; Roberts said. </font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>About the   Clinic</b></font></p>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UCF Communicative   Disorders Clinic offers a variety of low-cost rehabilitation and testing   services to adult clients with impaired speech or language abilities due to a   stroke, traumatic brain injury or degenerative diseases like Alzheimers and Lou   Gehrigs. It also helps children with special needs in communication, language   and literacy. The clinic serves more than 400 people a year.
