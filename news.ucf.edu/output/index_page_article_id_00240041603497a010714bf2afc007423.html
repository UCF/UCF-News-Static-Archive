			<p>The University of Central Florida Board of Trustees on Wednesday approved construction of an on-campus football stadium, pending final approval of financing, and amended the campus master plan to include the stadium.</p><p>Construction of the planned 45,000-seat stadium on the East Orlando campus could begin within the next few months and be completed before the 2007 football season.</p><p>UCF President John Hitt said the university will move forward quickly to raise private donations for the stadium and to complete its planning.</p><p>This will be a better campus with the stadium, Board of Trustees Chair Dick Nunis said following the board vote Wednesday.</p><p>The board plans to hold a workshop meeting next month to review financing for the project and could approve its cost, expected to be $50 million to $60 million, soon afterward. The stadium will be built and supported by ticket and concessions sales, donations, corporate sponsorships and advertising.</p><p>The board approved the amendment to the master plan, a blueprint for growth and development at the university, during its regular meeting Wednesday after the second of two required public hearings. The amendment was also reviewed and endorsed by about a dozen state agencies before the second hearing.</p><p>The university has held 20 public meetings to discuss the stadium since it was first proposed nearly a year ago. In April, the Board of Trustees endorsed the concept and directed staff to negotiate finance and construction agreements.</p><p>More than 40 people spoke during the hearing Wednesday. Nearly all of the speakers said they were in favor of building the stadium on the campus, and about three-fourths also supported the northern location.</p><p>The stadium will be located just east of the UCF Arena in the north intercollegiate athletics complex. The site is next to new housing for 2,000 students, the Fairwinds Alumni Center, shops, restaurants and a planned 10,000-seat convocation center.</p><p>Building the stadium on a south site suggested by some residents would have required the university to remove existing parking and build new lots, displace intramural sports fields, mitigate for the loss of a wetland, expand storm water ponds and reconfigure utilities. It would also have involved building new access roads, one of which would have required that the university purchase land from the adjacent Central Florida Research Park.</p><p>The north site can accommodate a stadium without such impacts because it already has the needed infrastructure in place.</p><p>We need to serve our community as a whole, Trustee Olga Calvet said. And to better serve our community, we need to build a stadium and build it on the north site.</p><p>UCF has played at the Florida Citrus Bowl stadium near downtown Orlando since the football teams inaugural season in 1979.</p><p><strong>In other action Wednesday, the board:</strong></p><p>-- Approved a resolution honoring the life of Mario Jenkins, the UCF police officer who was accidentally shot and killed outside the Citrus Bowl Sept. 24. The UCF community has suffered from losing a valuable and caring member of its family, the resolution says. We are determined to keep alive the memory of Officer Mario R. Jenkins for his unwavering commitment to the safety and protection of the UCF community.</p><p>The board also heard an update on the task force that was formed to examine alcohol use and tailgating policies following the tragedy. The group developed a policy that increased awareness, created ambassadors who mingle with tailgaters and called for an increased presence of uniformed officers at such events. </p><p>-- Received an update on the division of the College of Arts and Sciences into the College of Arts and Humanities and College of Sciences. </p><p>Arts and Humanities will have two divisions: Visual and Performing Arts, which will include the departments of Art, Music, Theatre and the School of Film and Digital Media; and Humanities, which will include the departments of English, History, Modern Languages and Literatures, Philosophy and Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies. Arts and Sciences Dean Kathryn Seidel will become dean of the College of Arts and Humanities.</p><p>The College of Sciences will have the divisions of Natural Sciences, with the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics and Actuarial Science; and Social and Behavioral Sciences, with the departments of Political Science, Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology and the Nicholson School of Communication. Peter Panousis, director of UCFs Institute for Economic Competitiveness since 2003, was named interim dean of the college while a national search is conducted for a dean. </p><p>-- Approved an honorary doctorate for Puerto Rico Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá. The degree will be conferred at Orlandos 2nd Annual Hispanic Summit in March.</p><p>-- Approved conferral of degrees for the fall commencement. UCF expects to award 3,377 degrees during ceremonies on Dec. 12 and 13.</p><p>During a special ceremony Wednesday morning, members of the boards of trustees of UCF and Brevard, Lake-Sumter, Seminole and Valencia community colleges signed a Community College Consortium Agreement to enhance a regional partnership that streamlines transfers and expands program offerings. <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=00240041603497a010714bf2afc007494">Read more</a>.</p><p>The Board of Trustees next meeting will be held Jan. 26.
