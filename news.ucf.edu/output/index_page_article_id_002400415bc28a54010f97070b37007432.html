			<p><strong><a href="mms://webcast.oir.ucf.edu/archived/SOUfinnish.wmv">VIEW WEBCAST</a></strong></p><p><strong>University of Central Florida President John C. Hitt</strong></p><p>Good morning and welcome. </p><p>Its good to see so many friends of UCF here this morning. </p><p>Your presence demonstrates your interest in your hometown university -- the University of Central Florida.</p><p>When youre fortunate -- as I am -- to be able to spend much of your time immersed in the day-to-day business of UCF, it can be easy to take for granted the exciting developments that typify a large, vibrant metropolitan research university. </p><p>But as I consider the past year and the milestones that the university has achieved -- in concert with this wonderfully supportive community -- I cannot help but marvel at what has been a truly remarkable year. I am delighted to have an opportunity to reflect on these accomplishments with good friends. Without the support of so many of you here in this room -- individuals, as well as the businesses, organizations, and communities you represent -- we would not be celebrating some of these achievements. </p><p>Before going any farther, I want to take a moment to recognize the community partners who are helping to make this mornings event possible. </p><p>Our media sponsor is the Orlando Business Journal. Gold sponsors are Bright House Networks, the Florida High Tech Corridor Council, GrayRobinson, Mirabilis, OUC -- the Reliable One, and Turner Construction. Silver sponsors are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Florida Hospital, LarsonAllen (you may remember them as the accounting firm of Chastang, Ferrell, Sims &amp; Eiserman), Orlando Regional Healthcare and Solantic Walk-in Urgent Care. The City of Orlando is an in-kind sponsor.</p><p>Please help me thank all of this mornings sponsors for their support of our State of the University program.</p><p>(ACKNOWLEDGES OTHER VIPs) </p><p>Weve all read the headlines and seen the news this past year:</p><p>-- The state Board of Governors approves a new college of medicine at UCF, giving substance to plans for a medical city at Lake Nona, and fueling a new driver for Central Floridas economic engine.</p><p>-- The universitys Board of Trustees gives the go-ahead to a 45,000-seat on-campus football stadium. Bright House Networks steps forward and makes a $15 million commitment to name the new stadium.</p><p>-- After a highly competitive search, the prestigious Burnham Institute announces that they will locate their East Coast headquarters near the UCF medical school at Lake Nona.</p><p>-- The concept of a creative village in downtown Orlando anchored by the UCF School of Film and Digital Media begins to take shape.</p><p>And, of course, theres much more. Those are just some of the more memorable highlights from the past 12 months or so.</p><p>While it might be tempting to celebrate these high points as accomplishments that have come about because of extraordinary recent efforts and the talent and resources in place today, none of these things could have happened without the vision and courage of the UCF pioneers who built this university.</p><p>In 1963, a group of visionaries -- business, political and community leaders -- launched an institution that would provide opportunities for new generations to achieve their dreams.</p><p>They envisioned an academic institution that would provide opportunities for the pursuit of knowledge -- engineering, for those who strove to reach the moon; science, for those who dreamed of harnessing new technologies; education, for those who dreamed of shaping yet another generation; art and philosophy, for those who dreamed of exploring mankinds efforts to communicate our most profound ideas.</p><p>Eighty-nine individuals pledged at least $10,000 each to raise $1 million to help realize the dream of a new university in what was then far-away East Orange County. But it required more than money to turn that dream into reality.</p><p><strong>(BEGIN FIRST VIDEO)</strong></p><p>HITT (VIDEO TRACK): One major task was to turn 1,200 or so acres of scrub pine and sand hills east of town into the facility the founders envisioned. For this daunting project we turned to Charles Millican, who became the founding president of Florida Technological University.</p><p>MILLICAN (ON FILM):  President of 1,200 acres of pine trees and a couple of lakes. When I first saw the land I was impressed with the beauty of it. When I began to meet the folks in the community, I knew that I had their support in the establishment of the new university. It was a question of converting ideas to blueprints and blueprints to action.</p><p>HITT (VIDEO TRACK): Those actions took years, but the decisions that were made  the mindset that was established  the visions that were generated  echo to this day. By 1968, the first buildings were ready and the first 1,900 students began taking the opportunity to pursue their dreams. There have been a few changes since then. Change has been a daily fact in our story, from a name change to the University of Central Florida  from a small local school to a nationally known, multi-campus university with 47,000 students ... from a handful of buildings out in the orange groves to the 7th largest university in the country.</p><p><strong>(END FIRST VIDEO)</strong></p><p>We continue to change. And, along with this community, we continue to grow.  In fact, some reports now list us as the 6th largest university in the country in enrollment.</p><p>In the past 15 years, our enrollment has doubled. Research funding has tripled, and weve quadrupled the number of doctoral degrees we award.</p><p>The number of colleges serving varied disciplines from the humanities to biomedical sciences has increased to 12 -- the most recent additions being the College of Medicine and the College of Nursing. Both will be central to the medical city at Lake Nona.</p><p>At the same time, weve joined with partners to add programs across the region. In just the past few years, for example, we opened the world-class Rosen College of Hospitality Management near International Drive and we established the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy here in downtown Orlando.</p><p>However, we all know that it is not simply quantity, but quality that matters. And by any number of measures, we have grown in that regard as well.</p><p>The average SAT score for entering freshmen this year jumped from 1178 to 1201. That is a significant increase in just one year.</p><p>At UCFs Burnett Honors College, which accepted 479 incoming freshmen, the average SAT score this fall was 1353 while the average high school GPA was 4.05.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, SACS -- the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools -- renewed UCFs accreditation. SACS is an accrediting body whose goal is to assure and enhance quality in higher education. Colleges and universities go through a lengthy and rigorous reaffirmation process every 10 years, and I am delighted to report that UCF got an outstanding evaluation.</p><p>We can look at other measures of quality as well.</p><p>Distinguished faculty members conduct breakthrough research, serve on national and international boards, and draw the eyes of the world to this community.</p><p>UCF has become a national and world leader in areas that include optics and lasers, modeling and simulation, computer science, education and hospitality management, among other areas. And were rapidly growing our programs in biotechnology and biomedical research.</p><p>Indicative of our expanding expertise, UCF has attracted more than $100 million in research money two years in a row. In addition to having a positive economic impact, research funding is another clear indication of quality. As the College of Medicine and Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences generate new scientific and biomedical investigative studies, we can expect to see research dollars climb even more dramatically.</p><p>The quality of an educational institution may also be measured by its graduates.</p><p>Lets have a show of hands of those of you in the audience who are UCF alumni. Look around. You are in good company. More than 80,000 alumni now reside in this area.</p><p>UCF alumni lead businesses, organizations, and governmental entities such as Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, SeaWorld, NASAs Kennedy Space Center, Ruths Chris Steak House, the Tavistock Group, Orange County, and many, many others.</p><p>More than ever, our students, staff, faculty, alumni and partners are energizing the Central Florida economy and changing the world.</p><p>UCF TV Channel hosts Ed Heiland and Charna Davis Wiese will tell us about that.</p><p><strong>(BEGIN SECOND VIDEO)</strong></p><p>HEILAND (VIDEO TRACK): UCFs 80,000 local graduates are integral to the fiber of our community and quality of our institutions and business.</p><p>WIESE (VIDEO TRACK): For example, in our schools  UCFs College of Education provides more new teachers each year than any other university in the state. One program, offered in partnership with Osceola County Schools, helps school district employees, such as bus drivers and teachers aides like Patty Walker to become certified teachers for the district.</p><p>HEILAND: Beyond the basics, the college is a major center of sponsored research at UCF  $16 million last year  finding ways to improve general education techniques  to meet the needs of special students through the Toni Jennings Exceptional Education Institute, and with a new national center for reading, will address one of the nations fundamental needs.</p><p>WIESE: UCFs nursing students learn their profession on the job, working in clinics in underserved communities throughout the region. Hundreds of people also take advantage of the services offered by UCFs Communication Disorders Clinic.</p><p>HEILAND: A real-time information-sharing data base developed by UCF Criminal Justice and Computer Science researchers has greatly enhanced the way police departments can work together to solve crimes and catch criminals. The new system has already helped law enforcement make over 700 arrests.</p><p>WIESE: Then there is the environment. UCF researchers played a role in changing development laws to protect endangered turtles that nest along our coasts. Now biologists have identified a new threat, an invasive species of mollusk that could be a problem in Brevard Countys Mosquito Lagoon.</p><p>HEILAND: UCF engineering researchers have won national awards for their work helping clean up toxic chemicals at the Kennedy Space Center, and a research project on preserving water utility distribution systems is one of the largest at the university.</p><p>WIESE: Development pressures on the environment are a major concern in the region. UCFs Metropolitan Center for Regional Studies is helping planners decide how to sustain growth without destroying the aquifer that makes life possible here, or paving over the natural spaces that make Central Florida so attractive and unique.</p><p>HEILAND: UCF also plays a major role in Central Floridas cultural life  with the Orlando UCF Shakespeare Festival, The Orlando Repertory Theater in the former Civic Theater complex, now renovated, and the Music Theater Masters program at the Seaside Music Theater at the News Journal Center in Daytona Beach.</p><p>WIESE: Then there are the dozens of concerts every year by the UCF Orchestra, the UCF Chorus ... which participates in Orlando Opera productions, too  smaller presentations by music faculty and students, and on-campus performances by students in the UCF Conservatory Theater.</p><p>HEILAND: Several students recently won top awards in a national theater competition at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.</p><p>WIESE: This mixture of quality education and community partnership elevates the cultural quality of life in Central Florida, and ensures a steady flow of skilled and talented graduates to meet the entertainment industry needs in this, one of the top tourist destinations in the world.</p><p>HEILAND: The Rosen College of Hospitality Management, located on its own campus near the heart of the tourist district, now hosts more than 1,900 students, learning the skills they will need to be the next generation of leaders in the hospitality industry.</p><p>WIESE: As Central Floridas economy diversifies, UCF is expanding opportunities for students to enter exciting new fields. The School of Film and Digital Media is now operating in a fully renovated facility downtown at the former Expo Centre. Home to the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, it is giving a growing number of students the opportunity to train for jobs in the expanding video game industry.</p><p>HEILAND: UCFs College of Optics and Photonics is helping with that diversification. Now the home to two state centers of excellence, the technology developed in their labs has already led to the formation of several high-tech companies.</p><p>WIESE: Speaking of business, the UCF College of Business Administration, one of the largest in the nation, is the only business college in the area with accredited programs in both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p><p>HEILAND: On the national level the DeVos Sports Management Program was recently named one of the top five sport business management programs in the nation.<br />WIESE: UCF is helping elevate the educational level of Central Floridas workforce  a factor that is more important than ever as the area strives to attract new industry.</p><p>HEILAND: Of course, a lot of those new businesses will be in the biomedical field. They will find a successful and growing nucleus of researchers and spin-off business already in place. The Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences already has 24 world-class researchers exploring topics ranging from ways to keep cancers from spreading to how to keep cancer from growing in the first place.</p><p>WIESE: In one case of from-lab-to-market, a technology to grow vaccines in tobacco plants has resulted in the creation of a new company.</p><p>HEILAND: As impressive as all this is, we are not done yet.</p><p>WIESE: President Hitt, what does the future look like?</p><p><strong>(END SECOND VIDEO)</strong></p><p>Well, Im reminded of the warning that He who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass.</p><p>And, while I dont have, nor would I necessarily want, a crystal ball, I feel certain that we have even more exciting opportunities ahead of us.</p><p>Lets talk about some of what you can expect to see this year.</p><p>Three major construction projects will be completed in support of UCFs academic and athletics missions.</p><p>A new psychology building is opening this spring, providing more teaching and research opportunities for students who are part of our largest major.</p><p>The psychology building follows recent additions of the Harris Corporation Engineering Center, the Progress Energy University Welcome Center, and the expansion of the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers.</p><p>This fall, well kick off the Knights football season in the new 45,000-seat Bright House Networks Stadium. It will help bring the best student-athletes to UCF and provide an exciting, on-campus game-day experience for students, alumni, and fans. That first game should, indeed, be very exciting as we hit the field against the University of Texas Longhorns.</p><p>The Convocation Center will open about the same time. The center, which includes a 10,000-seat arena for basketball, shows, and other entertainment, is the centerpiece of a project that includes shops, restaurants, and 2,000 beds in four student-housing towers. You will want to come to some of the special events planned for a week-long official introduction of this new venue to the community.</p><p>With all these additions, just imagine the possibilities for an outing on campus: shopping and dinner capped off with a show or, better yet, a Knights basketball game in the Convocation Center or a football match-up in Bright House Stadium.</p><p>I would be remiss not to mention that, whether youre watching football or basketball at UCF, you are watching national champions. The UCF cheerleading squad captured its second national championship title just a few weeks ago at the College Cheerleading and Dance Team Nationals at Disney's Wide World of Sports. If youve ever seen a cheerleading competition, you know just how much talent is required. We are proud of these young athletes. They do a great job.</p><p>Now, back to the future, and let me invite you to stretch your imagination just a bit further and envision another addition to our campus -- a performing arts center -- a center that would provide strong support to our excellent music and theater programs while offering the community a rich cultural resource. Nice idea, dont you think?</p><p>Across the region, UCF will continue to expand its presence in downtown and regional campuses. Planning is underway for a joint campus with Seminole Community College. Were also seeking funding for a similar venture with Valencia Community College. And more students will benefit from the DirectConnect to UCF program that guarantees graduates of partnering community colleges a seat at UCF.</p><p>Downtown, we will build on our successful partnership with the city of Orlando to establish a creative village that is luring high-tech companies to the regions growing digital industry. We will complete the move of the UCF Film and Digital Media students into the new campus right here. The development of this campus, including the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, is already proving to be a great investment in the future of Orlandos digital economy.</p><p>(Incidentally, if you have not done so and you have time this morning, you may take a tour of the facility after this program.)</p><p>Since its inception, UCF has proven to be an economic driver for this region -- whether educating and preparing a work force to attract and support new industry or through the impact of the university as an economic engine itself.</p><p>With approximately 9,000 employees, we are the areas 7th largest employer. The most recent economic impact study by the UCF Institute of Economic Competitiveness shows that we have a direct and indirect impact on the regional economy of about $1.7 billion annually. For every $100 we spend in the community, other businesses spend another $141. And for every 100 jobs we generate, the business community creates another 89 as a result.</p><p>Just 10 years ago, working with the University of South Florida, we started the Florida High Tech Corridor Council to attract, retain, and grow high-tech industry. The corridor stretches from Tampa/St. Petersburg to the Space Coast, includes 23 counties, and is home to about 135,000 employees working at 7,600 companies doing business in the councils 10 targeted sectors. The University of Florida joined in 2005, expanding the corridor north to Gainesville.</p><p>Economic opportunity is also being provided by our award-winning Technology Incubator, which has created nearly 700 jobs and generated more than $200 million a year in revenue. Like the university and the region, those numbers too will grow.</p><p>On the horizon, the greatest economic development opportunity yet may be the new UCF College of Medicine and the biomedical cluster already forming around it. The medical school and the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences will anchor the planned UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona that will start taking shape this year.</p><p>The approval of the medical college this past year and the fact that our region has two of the nations leading hospital systems -- Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Healthcare -- helped attract the Burnham Institute.</p><p>Burnhams decision to co-locate with the medical school will help to lure other biotechnology researchers and companies to the area. Already, the Veterans Administration has indicated they will build a new hospital in the area.</p><p>Within 10 years, this life sciences cluster could provide as much as $6.4 billion in annual economic activity and nearly 26,000 jobs.</p><p>While the economic benefit will be significant, there will be increased access to medical research and new levels of care that will help improve our lives and the quality of life in this region in ways that cannot easily be quantified.</p><p>None of this will happen without an enormous amount of effort on the part of the university and our community partners. We have had a remarkable year, but there is much, much work to do to realize the potential of a medical school and the new UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona. Just ask Dr. Deb German, the new dean of the UCF College of Medicine. Deb? Your plate is full.</p><p>So when people ask, Whats next for UCF? clearly there are exciting opportunities and possibilities ahead. Many of those opportunities will be defined by this community.</p><p>We will work together with the region and with our partners in the community to identify needs and find ways we can help address those needs -- sometimes through programs of study and research and sometimes with more active participation.</p><p>UCF is still a very young university. We have never considered ourselves to be an ivory tower.  Rather, we believe that we must stand alongside our neighbors, our fates and fortunes intertwined, sharing resources and a common commitment to improving lives by expanding opportunities.</p><p>We have often said that there can be no truly great city without a great university.  But it is equally true that there can be no truly great university without a great community.</p><p>What lies ahead? We have begun to realize some of the golden opportunities that those leaders envisioned in 1963 and that you have helped us bring to fruition. But I am convinced that this is just a beginning and that the best is yet to come.</p><p>Never forget that UCF stands for opportunity.</p>
