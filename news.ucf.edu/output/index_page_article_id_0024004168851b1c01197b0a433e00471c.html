			<p>Business, government and academic leaders from the United States and other countries discussed international finance and trade, as well as Florida&rsquo;s role in the global economy, during a statewide public forum Wednesday, April 16, at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>Nearly 400 people participated in the &ldquo;Florida International Summit 2008: The State of Global Finance and Trade,&rdquo; which featured three keynote speakers and two panels. The event was sponsored by the UCF Global Perspectives Office.</p>
<p>Opening keynote speaker John Adams, the president of Enterprise Florida, Inc., started on a positive note, saying, &ldquo;The sky is not falling. Florida is rocking and rolling.&rdquo; He noted that there is demand everywhere for exports and that companies -- especially companies in Central Florida with a focus on technology and, more recently, life sciences -- can export just about anything they want. In addition to English, the languages of business in the 21st century will increasingly be Chinese and Spanish, Adams said, and those languages should be emphasized in schools.</p>
<p>The first panel of the day, moderated by John C. Bersia, special assistant to the president for Global Perspectives at UCF, focused on global markets. It featured IBM&rsquo;s Sandra Johnson, who also serves as vice president for Life for Africa; Terry McCoy, who directs the Latin America Business Environment Program at the University of Florida; Qubad Talabani, who represents the Kurdistan Regional Government in the United States; and Michael Taylor, who manages government affairs at the U.S. India Business Alliance.</p>
<p>Johnson discussed IBM&rsquo;s focus on global technology innovation, including a special emphasis on Africa. That continent is important, she said, because it represents a blank slate of economic opportunity; has a young median age; is multilingual; has great quantities of natural and human resources; and has a low base of economic activity that sets the stage for rapid economic development. Johnson stressed that, given the opportunity to develop, Africans&rsquo; innovation will help improve their overall quality of life and probably contribute greatly to the global economy.</p>
<p>McCoy stated that the &ldquo;news from Latin America continues to be encouraging and positive,&rdquo; with poverty levels down, incomes rising, social welfare programs that are helping to reduce inequality and greater access to global markets. However, all is not perfect. Latin America still faces the problems of crime and corruption in many countries, he said, and these must be factored into the cost of doing business in the region.</p>
<p>Talabani drew some comparisons between Kurdistan and Central Florida, indicating that both offer a good quality of life, have no state income tax and have access to more than one international airport. He also said that Kurdistan &ndash; known often as the &ldquo;Iraq that works&rdquo; &ndash; has an educated workforce; is ready to develop its technology industries; can act as a bridge to Iraq and the rest of the Middle East; is building democratic institutions; and has a huge potential for agriculture.</p>
<p>Talabani also praised UCF for <a href="index?page=article&amp;id=0024004106d0153250118a4e1f9bb007f83">creating an endowed chair in Kurdish Political Studies</a>, adding that this will help bring awareness about the success of the Kurdish people, despite years of genocide and oppression by the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Taylor focused on India&rsquo;s competitive advantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages he listed were India&rsquo;s dynamic economy; a sound and independent legal system; a large and growing consumer market with a middle class as large as 350 million people; and a vast pool of skilled English-speakers. Among India&rsquo;s disadvantages Taylor cited were its underdeveloped infrastructure, which needs to penetrate the rural areas; bureaucracy; government over-regulation; and corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luncheon keynote speaker Jeffrey Birnbaum, a commentator for The Washington Post, PBS and Fox News, said the contentious 2000 election was followed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. With a renewed spirit of patriotism, Birnbaum said, Bush expanded the government by unbelievable measures to protect democracy. He also waged two wars and required citizens to re-examine their concept of what it meant to be American. Shortly thereafter, Birnbaum said, Enron collapsed, and American investors required more transparency in U.S. corporate structure, which led to a decline in business and investment. This was a seminal period, according to Birnbaum, that requires critical examination because it severely tested the American fabric.</p>
<p>Focusing on the current economic crisis, Birnbaum stated, &ldquo;The most important question is how long the recession will last and if economics will influence the election as it has in the past.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said that a declining economy will likely lead to a Democratic win, while a stronger economy will result in a victory for Republicans.</p>
<p>The afternoon panel, moderated by Kenneth Mouradian of the U.S. Department of Commerce, emphasized Florida perspectives on trade, finance and the economy. It featured Manny Mencia, senior vice president of Enterprise Florida, Inc.; Cynthia Flores, vice president for Global Trade Solutions at SunTrust; Cathy Blalock, regional representative for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and Sean Snaith, director of UCF&rsquo;s Institute for Economic Competitiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing keynote speaker Charles S. Shapiro, the senior coordinator for the Western Hemisphere Free Trade Agreement Task Force and a former ambassador to Venezuela, highlighted the importance of trade with Latin America to the United States and particularly Florida. He noted that eight of the top 10 destinations for Florida exports are in the Western Hemisphere. He also stressed the importance of free-trade agreements, stating that in there are several pending in Congress, and that it is time for lawmakers to address the Colombian free-trade agreement. He also emphasized the need for democracy, stating that &ldquo;there is a need for representative democracies with open economies to help increase the standard of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the Global Perspectives Office, sponsors of the event included C.T. Hsu and Associates, Inc.; Deshpande, Inc.; Enterprise Florida, Inc.; the Florida Network for Global Studies (UCF, University of Florida, University of South Florida, Florida International University and Florida A&amp;M University); the Georgetown Club of Metro Orlando; IBM; LarsonAllen, LLP; the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission; the Orlando Regional Chamber of Commerce; SunTrust; UCF&rsquo;s&nbsp; College of Business Administration, Diplomacy Program; International Services Center; LIFE program; Middle Eastern Studies Program, Political Science Department and India Program; Junior Achievement of Central Florida; and the Global Connections Foundation.</p>
