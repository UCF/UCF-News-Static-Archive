			<p>Terry Rooney, who helped guide LSU to the 2008 College World Series, has been selected as the head coach of the UCF baseball program, director of athletics and executive vice president Keith R. Tribble announced Thursday. Rooney is concluding his second year at LSU, where he currently serves as the Tigers' associate head coach.</p>
<p>&quot;We are thrilled to have Terry and his wife, Shaun, join the UCF Athletics family. Terry's on and off the field successes have been apparent over the years and we are excited to have him lead our program as it starts a new chapter,&quot; said Tribble. &quot;I am confident UCF baseball will graduate a record amount of student-athletes and compete for championships under Terry Rooney.&quot;</p>
<p>Rooney has 12 years of experience as an assistant coach at the Division I level. Prior to joining the staff at LSU, where he also serves as the Tigers' pitching coach and recruiting coordinator under head coach Paul Mainieri, Rooney was the pitching coach at Notre Dame for three years.</p>
<p>In two campaigns at LSU, Rooney has helped the Tigers record 77 victories. LSU has won 48 games in 2008 and is currently ranked fourth nationally. The Tigers will open play at the College World Series in Omaha, Neb., on Sunday. Following the event, Rooney will begin his tenure at UCF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rooney's current LSU pitching staff is among the best in the country. The Tigers are 12th nationally in walks allowed per nine innings and 20th in the country in earned run average.</p>
<p>Rooney is no stranger to the Sunshine State. He served as the pitching coach at Stetson from 2002-03. During his time in DeLand, the Hatters made a pair of appearances in the NCAA Regionals.</p>
<p>Rooney, 35, was promoted to associate head coach at LSU in July 2007. His 2007 recruiting class was selected as the top class in the nation by Collegiate Baseball magazine. The group included nine players who were picked in the Major League Baseball Draft.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2003, Rooney arrived at Notre Dame, where his primary role centered on instructing the program's pitching staff, while also serving as the recruiting coordinator. His previous eight seasons as an assistant included time serving as pitching coach with four programs -- George Washington, James Madison, Old Dominion and Stetson.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight of Rooney's pitchers have been selected in the MLB Draft, with 10 taken in the first 10 rounds. Four LSU pitchers were tabbed in the 2008 draft, and five pitchers that he mentored while at Notre Dame were also selected.</p>
<p>Rooney's student-athletes have also excelled in the classroom. Eight LSU players garnered all-academic honors from the Southeastern Conference a year ago. While at Notre Dame, Rooney helped two players earn ESPN The Magazine Academic All-America recognition.</p>
<p>A native of Fairfax, Va., Rooney is considered one of the nation's premier recruiters. He has been involved with eight recruiting classes that have been ranked among the national leaders, including the No. 1 class at LSU a year ago and Notre Dame's 2006 group that was rated as the country's seventh-best class.</p>
<p>Notre Dame participated in the NCAA Regionals in each of Rooney's three years at the school. His 2004 pitching staff posted a 3.43 ERA, good for ninth in the nation. The 2006 Irish staff allowed just 18 home runs and set or tied four school pitching records.</p>
<p>Twelve of Rooney's pitchers at Notre Dame were drafted. In 2006, three Irish hurlers were selected, including Jeff Samardzjia in the fifth round by the Chicago Cubs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Rooney's two campaigns at Stetson, the Hatters posted a pair of 40-victory seasons. Under Rooney's tutelage, four Stetson pitchers garnered All-Atlantic Sun Conference honors and two were taken in the MLB Draft. Rooney's 2006 Stetson recruiting class was ranked 12th nationally by Baseball America.</p>
<p>Rooney worked at Old Dominion from 2000-01. The Monarchs earned an NCAA Regional berth as a No. 2 seed in 2000. Four of the pitchers he coached at Old Dominion went on to professional baseball, most notably Justin Verlander, who is now one of the American League's top hurlers with the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>Rooney's two years at James Madison (1998-99) included a pair of nationally ranked recruiting classes, as he first assumed the role of pitching coach/recruiting coordinator in 1999. Two of his pitchers were later drafted in the first 10 rounds. Rooney began his coaching career in 1997 at George Washington.</p>
<p>Rooney has experience coaching in top wood-bat summer leagues. He served as the head coach for Waynesboro (Va.) in 1998 when the Generals claimed the Valley League title. Rooney also spent time as an assistant with Valley League champion Staunton (Va.) in 1996 and Cotuit in the Cape Cod League in 1997.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 1996 Radford graduate with a degree in social science, Rooney pitched for the Higlanders for three seasons. He ranks second all-time at the school with 79 appearances and posted an 8-2 career record. Rooney played one season at Davis &amp; Elkins College in West Virginia, compiling a 4-2 mark.</p>
<p>Rooney and his wife, Shaun, were married in December of 2007.</p>
