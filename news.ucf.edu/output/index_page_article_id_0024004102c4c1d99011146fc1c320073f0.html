			<p>About 25 friends, professors, members of his Army company and family members celebrated the milestone. The group included his wife, Julie, his 22-month-old daughter and his parents, George and Rosa, who live in West Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;We're so very proud of him for sticking with it, especially when the Army keeps pulling him away,&quot; Julie McKinney said.</p>
<p>Shawn McKinney held on tightly to the diploma and told friends that when he returns from Iraq, he'll consider graduate school at UCF. If not, a local engineering firm has offered McKinney a job when he returns.</p>
<p>McKinney, who has served in the military for nearly 13 years, is a combat engineer platoon leader. He leads a group of about 40 that is responsible for sweeping areas and removing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) left behind by insurgents. It's among the most dangerous work in the military.</p>
<p>&quot;All of this is a big deal for me,&quot; McKinney told a group at a reception held for him in the office of Civil and Environmental Engineering. &quot;But it's a bit uncomfortable, because you know there are a whole lot of guys just like me in the military. It's been an uphill battle to get this degree. And I thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>McKinney joined the Army in the late 1980s after working as a stockbroker for years. He said he wanted to make a change in his life and serve others. He went on active duty for two years, then onto the reserves before he started college. Since then, he's been pulled between his family and school at home and serving his country abroad. During his second deployment to the Middle East, his daughter Eryn was born.</p>
<p>&quot;Shawn missed most of the first year of his daughter's life. He has twice had to leave college because the military is not on a semester schedule,&quot; said Associate Dean Debra Reinhart. &quot;The least we can do is be flexible in helping Shawn and others like him to succeed at UCF.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Andrew Randall said men and women in the military make &quot;profound sacrifices so that our educational and social institutions can continue to exist. As a consequence, it is entirely appropriate to do what we can to make the educational system work for these individuals, especially in a time of war.&quot;</p>
<p>Classmates respect McKinney and are inspired by his commitment.</p>
<p>&quot;He's about the most intelligent person I know,&quot; said Heather Goldian, a senior who will graduate in May with degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering. &quot;It's very nice that UCF would do this. It gives military people an incentive to finish their degrees.&quot;</p>
<p>Carol Ann Pohl, undergraduate program director for civil and environmental engineering got to know McKinney over the years as he shipped off around the world. He would send her e-mails each time his schooling was interrupted. E-mails from Germany, Kuwait, Afghanistan and elsewhere were posted on the department's door, keeping professors -- even those who hadn't taught him&nbsp;-- updated on his activities. Care packages were sent to him, and as one classmate put it, &quot;he earned a place in everyone's heart even when he wasn't present.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone was willing to work together to make it happen,&quot; said Pohl who helped get the diploma ready in time. &quot;It's great, because every once in a while you get to do something really right, something really good. This is one of those times.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who serve with McKinney were equally thrilled to hear UCF was holding the special ceremony for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very special for him and for us,&quot; said Army Sgt. First Class Kirk Hamlin. He's part of a team that flew in from Fort Knox, Ky., to get McKinney's Orlando-based Bravo Company 841st Combat Engineer Battalion ready for Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;To have the university president, provost and others take time out of their busy schedules to recognize him is outstanding. It really shows that they appreciate what our military does.&quot;</p>
<p>The day was bittersweet for McKinney, who smiled, shook hands and held onto his blond-haired and blue-eyed toddler in a pink cotton dress. She clung to him, watching in silence. She'll turn 2 on May 27 -- 22 days after he leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;Leaving family is always the hardest thing,&quot; McKinney said. &quot;I wasn't there when Eryn was born, and I didn't meet her until she was six months. Now I'll miss her birthday -- I'm not quite sure how I'm going to do it this time. That's what's the hardest.&quot;</p>
