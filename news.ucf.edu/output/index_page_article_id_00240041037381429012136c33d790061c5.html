			<p>Lou Frey, the founder of UCF&rsquo;s Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government, will receive the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress&rsquo; 2009 Distinguished Service Award next week in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Frey, who represented Central Florida in Congress from 1969 to 1979, will be recognized for more than 50 years of public service that began when he joined the Navy in 1955.&nbsp; Today, Frey is a leading advocate of civics education in schools throughout Florida and the country.</p>
<p>He is the founder of the Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government, a nonpartisan organization housed in the UCF Department of Political Science. The institute promotes civic education and engagement, particularly among young people.</p>
<p>Working closely with former U.S. Senator and Florida Governor Bob Graham, Frey established the Florida Joint Center for Citizenship in 2008 to strengthen civic education at high schools throughout the state. The center, housed at UCF, promotes the development of enlightened, responsible and actively engaged citizens and is leading efforts to improve the teaching and learning of civics in Florida schools.</p>
<p>The Distinguished Service Award recognizes a former member of Congress who has shown an exemplary dedication to public service before, during, or after his or her time on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; This is the 37th year the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress has bestowed this award.&nbsp; Past recipients include Gerald Ford, Thomas &ldquo;Tip&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill, Dick Cheney, Al Gore, Bob Dole, and George Mitchell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frey will receive his award during a ceremony in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives on June 16.</p>
<p>In addition to Frey&rsquo;s service with the Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government and the Florida Joint Center for Citizenship, many of his other accomplishments also were cited by the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress in granting the award. They include:</p>
<p>-- After joining the Navy in 1955, Frey was on active duty until 1958, and he continued his military career in the Navy Reserve until 1978.</p>
<p>-- His life in politics and public service began in 1961 as an assistant county solicitor in Orange County.&nbsp; He later served five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was a member of the Republican House Leadership in the 93rd and 94th Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- While in Congress, Frey was instrumental in involving young Americans in their government.&nbsp;&nbsp; He co-authored the report on Youth of America titled &ldquo;Congress Looks at the Campus&rdquo; in 1969.&nbsp; The report called for the 18-year-old vote, draft reform, the expansion of various student loan programs, opposition to repressive legislation against colleges where protests against the Vietnam War took place, and the establishment of a Commission on Higher Education.&nbsp; He established a high school intern program where more than 300 students from his district elected by their peers came to Washington for seven days to learn first-hand about their government.</p>
<p>-- Frey has edited and written two books on the Congress.&nbsp; The first is &ldquo;Inside the House: Former Members Reveal How Congress Really Works.&rdquo; The second, out this year, is &ldquo;Political Rules of the Road: Representatives, Senators and Presidents Share their Rules for Success in Congress, Politics and Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-- As the first two-term president of the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress (1996-1998), Frey greatly improved the association&rsquo;s outreach to college students, particularly via the Congress to Campus Program (a project which sends a bipartisan team of former members of Congress to about 30 college campuses per academic year).&nbsp; He also initiated the association&rsquo;s sole fundraising event, The Statesmanship Award Dinner, which he has chaired since its inception 12 years ago.&nbsp; He remains active on the association&rsquo;s Board of Directors and has involved the organization in many of the public service projects of the Lou Frey Institute.&nbsp; In 2008, the two organizations partnered on the Civics Connection, which brings former Members of Congress into high school civics education classrooms via webcasts and the Internet.</p>
<p>The U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress (FMC) is a bipartisan group of almost 600 former Senators and Representatives. The organization was founded in 1970 and is chartered, but not funded, by the U.S. Congress. FMC seeks to promote the improved public understanding of the role of Congress as a unique institution as well as the crucial importance of representative democracy as a system of government, both domestically and abroad.&nbsp; For more detailed information, please visit the Association&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.usafmc.org">www.usafmc.org</a>.</p>
