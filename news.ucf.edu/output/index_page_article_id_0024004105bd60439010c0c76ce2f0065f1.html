			<p>More than 9 million children are obese in America, putting them at risk for heart disease, diabetes and a host of other medical problems. And with an emphasis on testing and other competing interests, physical education is being reduced or even cut in many schools.</p>
<p>Recognizing that children were becoming less motivated to exercise and chunkier as a result, University of Central Florida physical education professor Debby Mitchell designed GeoMats about three years ago to encourage more physical activity by making it fun and portable.</p>
<p>Today, 19 public schools in Orlando County use the fitness dance pad to get students in P.E. classes moving. And GeoFitness, MitchellÂ’s small company nurtured at UCFÂ’s Technology Incubator, started shipping 1,000 mats a month this summer to schools, after-school programs, gyms and senior centers around the country.</p>
<p>The mats look like giant phone pads. Kids follow a sequence of numbered steps while music blares. As health problems among children increase, itÂ’s more important than ever to get them moving, Mitchell said.</p>
<p>&quot;ItÂ’s amazing, especially with diabetes,&quot; said Mitchell, who has developed other, easy-to-use exercise equipment. &quot;In the case of type 2 it can be prevented with diet and good exercise. The number of children weÂ’re seeing with it is just so sad.&quot;</p>
<p>Mitchell is a 20-year veteran in education who has focused her research in fitness and integrating technology to help children learn. Mitchell received a $1 million Tech IMPACT grant from the U.S Department of Education in 2000 to research ways to better integrate technology into the classroom to help student improve learning.</p>
<p>When UCF began offering a degree in sports and fitness in 2003, Mitchell was named the coordinator of the program. She has also developed a Web site that has lesson plans and other guides to help physical education teachers with instruction.</p>
<p>The UCF alumna teaches a variety of courses at the university from dance and gymnastics to wellness development in children. She has also published several articles about the importance of exercise and good health and how technology can help maintain healthy lifestyles. In recent years her focus has been on youth, obesity and the early onset of diabetes because of a poor diet and exercise.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, 16 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 19 are overweight. In Florida, the CDC estimates that about 26 percent of high school students are overweight or at risk of becoming overweight. And 28 percent of low-income children ages 2 to 5 are overweight or at risk in Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed in one of my classes that the students just couldnÂ’t get these very simple dance moves down,&quot; said Mitchell, who teaches physical education courses in the College of Education. &quot;IÂ’d noticed over the years that the students I had were less coordinated. And being deep into obesity studies, I knew the health problems many of our youth are facing. So I went home and came up with the idea for a GeoMat.&quot;</p>
<p>The prototype was a vinyl tablecloth, designed like an ATM keyboard. It was big enough for an adultÂ’s foot to step onto each key. Mitchell combined number sequences with aerobic dance steps. She put the sequence to music and saw the students laughing. She knew that if her college students were having fun, it was likely that younger students would, too.</p>
<p>Jeanne Fifer, the wellness curriculum leader at Corner Lakes Middle School in Orlando, purchased mats for her school. As word spread of the ease of use and popularity among teens, more Orange County schools purchased the mats and newer products.</p>
<p>&quot;Obesity is the greatest health problem facing our nation at this time,&quot; Fifer said. &quot;Any form of motivation that addresses the problems of our sedentary youth is a positive contribution to this problem&quot;</p>
<p>Fifer said the GeoMats offer quick and challenging step moves that intrigue students. They are great for warm-ups and can be set up for specific training modules for strength, flexibility and cardio.</p>
<p>&quot;Many students have become quite creative in developing their own routines and dance moves,&quot; she said. &quot;They can work as a group, with a partner and or by themselves. Teachers love the new format and dance in middle school is possible with GeoFitness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;IÂ’m living a dream,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;IÂ’m teaching, doing research and actually providing something that will help children with their health. If we donÂ’t give them good healthy habits now, they wonÂ’t develop them when they get older, just because.&quot;</p>
