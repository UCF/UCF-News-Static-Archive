			<p>Most kids love watching sports and using their cell phones. Now they can do both while learning about science, math and nutrition in a new program developed by the University of Central Florida and Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.</p>
<p>About 60 seventh-graders at Glenridge and Lockhart middle schools in Orange County have been answering questions sent via text messages as part of the My Sports Pulse program. They receive and respond to some of the problems during their math classes and others at home.</p>
<p>The questions connect sports-themed scenarios, such as scoring a soccer goal or throwing a curveball, to principles of math, science, fitness and nutrition. In addition to text messages, voice mails and video clips with questions also are sent to participants. Professional athletes posed some of those scenarios.</p>
<p>My Sports Pulse, which will complete its pilot phase this month, is designed to promote student achievement and interests in math and science using mobile devices and sports-themed scenarios. The goal is to expand the program for use in conjunction with Olympic competitions and other major sporting events across the globe.</p>
<object width="375" height="294"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YAK0IBDxrzs&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YAK0IBDxrzs&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="375" height="294"></embed></object>
<p>Schools in Kansas City, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda are among the other participants in the pilot program. With 39 percent of youths owning cell phones, the trend around the world is to use mobile devices for gaming programs specifically focused on learning. Research also indicates that 95 percent of young people use gaming technology for entertainment and often learn from this technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look at the numbers, there are hundreds of millions of computers across the globe, but there are over 3 billion cell phones right now,&rdquo; said David Metcalf, the UCF Institute for Simulation and Training researcher who designed the program. &ldquo;We can reach a significantly larger number of students through the mobile technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sprint provided cell phones and wireless services to the My Sports Pulse participants. High-scoring students in Orange County have received prizes such as Orlando Magic tickets provided by the Orlando Hoops organization.</p>
<p>The Kauffman Foundation provided a grant to the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Simulation and Training as part of the foundation&rsquo;s 10-year commitment to math and science education.</p>
<p>IST provides a wide range of research and information services for modeling, simulation and training communities. IST developed the game and is running the program. University in Sweden and Higher Colleges of Technology in United Arab Emirates are working with IST.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kauffman Foundation has worked diligently with our partners to launch this program using cell phones as the newest frontier for learning about math, science and technology content as it relates to youth interest in sports,&rdquo; said Dennis Cheek, the Kauffman Foundation's vice president of Education. &ldquo;The wide availability of mobile phones around the world and their ever-increasing capabilities to handle voice, text, video and gaming simulations make them ideal learning tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How the My Sports Pulse Program Works</strong></p>
<p>Students receive the questions by pre-recorded audio and text messages. Major League Baseball and National Football League players have been invited to record opening and closing video segments and audio clips to introduce students to the sports concept used in each question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Sports Pulse sends sports scenarios over mobile phones to help kids with math and science,&rdquo; said Metcalf. &ldquo;With the Olympics around the corner next year, sports will be a unifying element across the world. We want to tap into this excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interaction begins when a student receives a question. If a student is unable to answer the phone, experiences a dropped call or needs a few minutes to research a solution, the student has the option to call back into the system. If students have trouble solving a problem, they can go to <a href="http://www.MySportsPulse.com">www.MySportsPulse.com</a> to get helpful links to appropriate Internet resources.</p>
<p>Points are awarded to students in five categories, including Science of Sport, Engineering of Equipment, Nutrition, Fitness and Will to Succeed. The first four categories have associated scenarios and questions. Students have several opportunities to answer each question. Their points received are based upon how many attempts are required to answer successfully. They also receive points in the Will to Succeed category for every question they try to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students can earn partial points even when they answer incorrectly,&rdquo; said Metcalf. &ldquo;We want to encourage students to strive to improve their performances even when they have trouble answering certain questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scoring system was implemented to create competition, add motivation and reward students for doing well. As students gain points, they reach new levels of achievement. Over the course of the program, they can become an Amateur, Rookie, Professional, Champion and, at the top, an Olympian. Students earn points or rewards, such as games and ring tones, sports gear and tickets to athletic events throughout the program. IST tracks the scores online and will announce both interim and overall winners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are at the cutting edge of making learning opportunities available to students 24/7 in a far more interesting and interactive manner,&rdquo; said Cheek. &ldquo;My Sports Pulse is one of a series of programs that the Kauffman Foundation is developing to help lead a global effort to optimize learning for the new millennium and digital age.&rdquo;</p>
