It will be held in the Pegasus Ballroom of the UCF Student <place />Union</place />. </p><p>To our knowledge, this is one of the few times that all of the governors of <state /><place />Florida</place /></state /> have appeared together, said Lou Frey, founder of the Lou Frey Institute and a Republican congressman who represented <place />Central Florida</place /> from 1969 to 1979. It is a historic event and will be interesting, informative and entertaining. </p><p>The Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government, which was founded in 2002, is a nonpartisan organization that promotes civic education for students and other <place />Central Florida</place /> residents. Go to <a href="http://www.loufrey.org/">www.loufrey.org </a>for more information.</p><p>Biographies of the participating governors and a full symposium schedule are included below.</p><p><b>Biographies of participating governors:</b></p><p>-- John Ellis Jeb Bush became the first Republican governor in <state /><place />Florida</place /></state />s history to win a second term when voters re-elected him in 2002. During his seven years in office, he has worked to improve education through increased standards and accountability and has reduced taxes while boosting the states reserves. He has increased health insurance coverage for children, committed state resources to preserving the <place />Everglades</place /> and held monthly office hours around the state so that citizens can meet with him. </p><p>-- Kenneth Buddy MacKay Jr. served seven years as lieutenant governor in Lawton Chiles administration and then became governor for three weeks after <country-region /><place />Chiles</place /></country-region /> died in 1998. An Air Force veteran, MacKay was a state legislator and served three terms in Congress before he joined <country-region /><place />Chiles</place /></country-region /> campaign. <country-region /><place />Chiles</place /></country-region /> and MacKay helped to establish <place /><city />Enterprise</city /> <state />Florida</state /></place /> to improve economic development and tourism and worked to make state government more efficient. They also strengthened prenatal and child-care services and won an $11.3 billion settlement for the state from the tobacco industry. </p><p>-- Robert Bob Martinez became the first Hispanic governor in any <country-region /><place />U.S.</place /></country-region /> state when he took office in 1987. He was the mayor of <city /><place />Tampa</place /></city /> before he ran for governor in 1986. <city /><place />Martinez</place /></city /> is known for improving the protection of wilderness areas and bodies of water such as <place />Lake Okeechobee</place />, <place /><placename />Tampa</placename /> <placetype />Bay</placetype /></place /> and the <place />St. Johns River</place />. He also strengthened the states drug enforcement programs. </p><p>-- Robert Bob Graham served as <state /><place />Florida</place /></state />s governor from 1979 to 1986 before moving on to the U.S. Senate in 1986. Prior to his tenure as governor, Graham served in the state House of Representatives and Senate for 12 years. Graham is known for supporting many environmental programs, as he signed laws that allowed the state to purchase and protect river floodplains, beaches, barrier islands and wetlands. He also encouraged the federal government to take a stronger role in thwarting illegal drug smuggling in <state /><place />Florida</place /></state />. </p><p>-- Reubin Askew was a state representative and senator before he served as governor from 1971 to 1979. He supported tax reform and racial justice and also led an effort to require candidates and public officials to disclose their finances. He named the first African-American Supreme Court justice in <state /><place />Florida</place /></state /> and appointed the first woman to the Florida Cabinet. A former Army paratrooper and Air Force second lieutenant, he is a professor of state government, public administration and public policy at <place /><placename />Florida</placename /> <placetype />State</placetype /> <placetype />University</placetype /></place />. </p><p>-- Claude Kirk Jr. became <state /><place />Florida</place /></state />s first Republican governor in nearly 100 years when he took office in 1967. A Marine who served in World War II and the Korean War, Kirk led the state at a time when a new constitution was approved and the office of the lieutenant governor was re-established. The Apollo 11 moon mission, which included Neil Armstrongs famous walk, also occurred during Kirks tenure as governor. </p><p /><p><b>Symposium schedule:</b></p><p>9:30-10:20 a.m.</time /> -- Governing <state /><place />Florida</place /></state /> Today: The Bush-Brogan/Jennings Years.
