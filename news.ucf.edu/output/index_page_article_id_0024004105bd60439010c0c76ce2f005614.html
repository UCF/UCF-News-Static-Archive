			<p>Shirley Burns cried last year after her daughter Aaliyah took the FCAT. But her tears werent out of desperation. They were out of joy.</p>
<p>If it werent for this camp, I know she wouldnt have passed, said Burns, of Orlando. This is awesome. It helps a lot and they care. My daughter used to not be able to read very well. Then she started coming here. This year her teacher told me shes reading at a fifth-grade level and shes in fourth grade.</p>
<p>Burns is one of hundreds of parents grateful for UCFs Saturday Reading Camp made possible through a partnership between the University of Central Florida and the city of Orlando. Education professor Timothy Blair began the camp six years ago as a way to teach his students the basics of teaching elementary school age children. They city got involved as a way to help at-risk students improve their literacy skills.</p>
<p>The camp teams up UCF education majors with three or four children in grades kindergarten through six for an hour and 15 minutes each Saturday morning at the Callahan Neighborhood Center and the Jackson Community Center. They meet for 10 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service is free thanks to grants Blair has received over the years. These days the program keeps going thanks to city grants, the Reed Elsevier Foundation in London and Blairs own checkbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great program, said Emily Alicano who began bringing her son&nbsp; this year after a friend told her about it. Even though the camp means a 35-minute ride from her home near the Orlando International Airport, she now she brings her son, nephew and one of his friends each week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like it because it really motivates the children, Alicano said. The first week my son didnt want to wake up, but now hes really excited to be here and I can already tell the difference. His reading has improved a lot, the school told me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program has grown over the years. Today 60 to 80 students attend each week during the fall and winter and again in the summer. Blair has added a parent education component after a pilot test last year. It begins this Saturday (Oct. 14).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man really cares, said Nilda Rubert, whos been brining her grandson to the Callahan Center for the past three years. I took the parenting class last year and it really taught me to work with my grandson at home, especially on sounding out words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blair beams when he sees the children come in each morning. He greets them and offers them a snack and drink before seeing them off to their study groups. He does the same at the end of each session reminding them to come back the following Saturday and calling them reading stars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camps help the community and, selfishly, it helps my students too, Blair said. It gives them real-life experience of teaching and of teaching some of the toughest students to reach. Many dont even own a book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UCF students must prepare weekly lesson plans, attend lectures in class and before the tutoring sessions each Saturday, in addition to completing required reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Blair hasnt compared FCAT scores of students who have been through his camps and those who havent, he has analyzed pre- and post-tests given to the campers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;About a one-third of the students who come every week, have moved up at least one reading level, Blair said. I believe nothing beats one-on-one tutoring. And as for my students, not only do they learn how to teach reading, they learn how to get to know their students. And I can tell you, the best teachers know their students and use that to help motivate them to learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its lessons UCF students are learning well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I absolutely love it, said Bebe Alinur, of Oveido. Shes in her third year of study in the College of Education. Its practical experience for me and gives me a chance to really work with each child. Theyre all at different reading levels, but thats the challenge Ill face in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Michelle Gonzalez, who could have taken a lecture-based class instead, the camp has helped confirm her career choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Id rather do, than talk about it in class, said the Kissimmee resident. My parents werent thrilled with my career choice -- too little money. But working in the camps makes me think teaching is the right choice for me. Just look at their faces when they learn something new. I love being a part of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blair is applying for several grants in hopes of expanding the program to other parts of the city. The funding he has now pays for teaching assistants at each center, the books used to teach, snacks and, this year, for a light breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is, some of these children havent had a good meal since they ate lunch at their schools on Friday, Blair said. If they are hungry, how are they expected to learn? Thats why we provide snacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;At the end of each camp the youngsters also get a pizza party and a book to take home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were interested in getting them to love reading, so they will be lifelong readers, Blair said. And that is one key to success.</p>
