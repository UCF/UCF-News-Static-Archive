			<p>President John Hitt, who has helped the University of Central Florida achieve many significant milestones during his 14-year tenure, reached one of his own during commencement Friday.</p>
<p>Hitt conferred the 100,000th degree of his tenure, a rare accomplishment for a university president, during this morning's graduation ceremony at the UCF Arena. The ceremony was the third of six that&nbsp;started Thursday, May 4,&nbsp;and concluded&nbsp;Saturday, May 6.</p>
<p>The 100,000th&nbsp;degree was awarded to Diane Burberry, a 22-year-old biology and molecular and microbiology major from West Melbourne. Burberry, who graduated magna cum laude, will continue her studies at UCF in the&nbsp;biomolecular sciences doctoral program.</p>
<p>About 5,400 UCF students declared their intentions to graduate this spring. They include 4,463 students scheduled to receive bachelors degrees, 857 for masters degrees, 104 for doctoral degrees and 18 for education specialist degrees.</p>
<p>Hitt&nbsp;has awarded degrees to more than 103,000 of about 159,000 graduates in the universitys history. Classes began in October 1968; Hitt has been president since 1992.</p>
<p>During the past year, UCF has awarded its 150,000th degree, achieved $100 million in research funding for the first time and received the state Board of Governors approval to create a medical college.</p>
<p>UCFs enrollment has nearly doubled during Hitts presidency to 45,090 this past fall. The university also achieved its highest-ranking ever from <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> in 2005, when it was ranked in the third tier of national universities.</p>
<p>Among Hitts other accomplishments in recent years are the openings of the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy in 2005 in downtown Orlando and the new Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus in 2004 near International Drive in the heart of one of the worlds top tourist destinations. The university plans to open an on-campus football stadium in time for the 2007 season.</p>
<p>Dr. Hitt deserves much of the credit for this great universitys growth and success, said UCF Board of Trustees Chairman Dick Nunis. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that thousands of Floridians have had access to quality higher education, and this milestone is a great testament to his efforts.</p>
<p>During the graduation ceremony Saturday morning, Florida&nbsp;Board of&nbsp;Governors member and Orlando attorney Tico Perez thanked College of Education students for&nbsp;deciding to become teachers.&nbsp;Aside from parents, teachers have the strongest influences on children, Perez said. They can&nbsp;teach them that everyone matters, to respect diversity and differences and to make decisions and act on them.</p>
<p>&quot;I can remember the names of my teachers all the way back to kindergarten,&quot; said Perez, who is a UCF alumnus and a former UCF trustee. &quot;I remember them because they mattered to me. I remember them because they made a difference to me and made a difference in me.&quot;</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Florida Secretary of Transportation Denver Stutler Jr. told graduates to give their best attitude and effort to everything they do. He spoke to graduates from the College of Engineering and Computer Science, Rosen College of Hospitality Management and College of Optics and Photonics.</p>
<p>&quot;My UCF professors prepared me well for my career, as I know they have prepared you,&quot; said Stutler, who received bachelor's and master's degrees in civil engineering from UCF. &quot;My engineering training was first-rate. It taught me how to think and gave me the technical underpinnings of my career.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking during the Friday afternoon ceremony, state Board of Governors member Ava Parker encouraged the graduates to continue to learn and &quot;build on the layers of your education.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please don't let that get away from you,&quot; Parker said. &quot;Right now, when you dream, dream big, because you have everything that it takes to achieve (those dreams).&quot;</p>
<p>Donna Arduin, a partner&nbsp;at Arduin,&nbsp;Laffer &amp; Moore Econometrics, addressed the graduates at Friday's morning ceremony.&nbsp;Arduin,&nbsp;who has helped craft the budgets for the governors of Florida and California, recounted&nbsp;having&nbsp;to tell California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that&nbsp;his state was about to run&nbsp;out of money as he was taking office.&nbsp;She encouraged students to seek out challenges.</p>
<p>&quot;Continue to find great opportunities,&quot; Arduin said, noting she has recently picked up a&nbsp;new challenge herself -- helping with the reconstruction of Iraq. &quot;Never give in, except to your conviction of honor and good sense.&quot;</p>
<p>During the first ceremony Thursday, Boeing Co. executive vice president Laurette Koellner addressed graduates of the College of Business Administration. She gave graduates&nbsp;good news about their job prospects: a survey has shown that, for the&nbsp;third straight year, the number of college graduates hired by companies will increase by at least 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Your challenge is to move business forward with values and integrity, and your UCF education has prepared you well for that,&quot; Koellner said. &quot;You are our future leaders, and I know we are in good hands.&quot;</p>
<p>Don Jernigan, president of Adventist Health Systems, addressed the students from the Burnett College of Biomedical Sciences and the College of Health and Public Affairs. He warned&nbsp;the graduates&nbsp;that the health care system is not perfect, but that they can do great things. He asked them to remember to be compassionate.</p>
<p>&quot;Human beings are not objects,&quot; said Jernigan, a former president and chief executive officer&nbsp;of&nbsp;Florida Hospital.&nbsp;&quot;Health care is not really a business enterprise.&quot;</p>
