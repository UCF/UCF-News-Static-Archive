			<p>UCF student Valerie Ryerson helped sixth-graders at Glenridge Middle School in Orlando collect and analyze Florida hurricane data and develop a short video about the dangers of hurricanes and how to prepare for them.</p><p>Ryersons project this semester was a required component of the Professional Teaching Practices course she is taking at the University of Central Florida. Its an example of service-learning, a teaching method in which students address a need in the community through volunteer activities that are connected to what they are learning in class. Learning takes place through structured reflections that ask students to connect the volunteer activities and class instruction.</p><p>UCF has received a state grant to create a graduate certificate program in service-learning and develop a Web site of best practices that will become a resource for teachers around the state. Through that same grant, Orange County Public Schools teachers who include service learning in their classes are mentoring UCF education students.</p><p>I think service-learning is a great way to teach children skills and keep them interested, because its so engaging that they dont even know theyre learning, said Ryerson, of Lake Mary. </p><p>Service-learning also is attracting more attention from the Florida Legislature. Rep. Rick Kriseman, D-St. Petersburg, introduced a bill to mandate service learning for all high school students as a requirement for graduation. The bill died in committee in late March, but Kriseman pledges to reintroduce it next year. He also said he will go on a campaign to newspaper editorial boards throughout the state to educate the public about its value.</p><p>Kriseman said service-learning enables children learn academics, help the community and develop a sense of civic responsibility needed for democracy to thrive.</p><p>Service-learning is much more than community service. Students at Glenridge learned the scientific reasons why hurricanes occur and how to divide, convert into percentages and analyze data they collected from surveys. They practiced writing skills when putting together brochures explaining what they found. And they will gain experience in public speaking when they present their findings at local elementary schools and businesses.</p><p>Assistant Professor Trae Stewart has been teaching service-learning courses at UCF since 2003, and he also researches the topic. Thats why he was tapped to work with Orange County Public Schools on the three-year grant from Floridas Learn and Serve program. </p><p>UCF students study service-learning as a system for teaching while they simultaneously complete a service-learning project in an Orange County public school. The Orange County teachers already use service learning regularly and mentor the UCF students. The goal is for graduating UCF students to know about, feel comfortable with and have experience with service-learning so they can teach it in their first year on the job.</p><p>Service-learning not only teaches academics, but it can also instill cultural and civic awareness, Stewart said. Its education for the development of participatory citizens through betterment of the community, which in essence is returning to the original purposes of education.</p><p>Stewart said the current Millennial Generation is very socially conscious, which can make service-learning more powerful.</p><p>Kimberly Allgood, a student in Stewarts class, worked with a Colonial High teacher on a Reading Buddies program. High school students read with children at Englewood and Brookshire elementary schools to develop their reading and comprehension skills. </p><p>UCF student Anthony Martin learned what it takes to manage a classroom while working with students at Evans High School. The high school students visited the Coalition for the Homeless to record the stories of residents. The collection of essays produced through the Everyone has a Story to Tell project was recently accepted for publication.</p><p>Martin said he was amazed by the stories that chronicled how people ended up on the streets. Many lost their jobs, had no families or experienced an event that could happen to any of us. It shattered his stereotype that all homeless people are drug addicts.</p><p>Wendy Doromal, the service-learning coordinator for OCPS, has been working with various UCF groups on service-learning projects for 10 years. She helped match students with teachers throughout the district, but especially at Timber Creek High School, the home of the districts Service-learning Academy. The academy enrolls about 1,200 students who must complete 75 hours of service-learning as part of the program.</p><p>Our district recognizes service-learning as a valuable teaching method that advances students' academic and effective growth, Doromal said. Service-learning is a bridge from the classroom to the community.</p><p>Doromal said UCF students worked with teachers on a variety of projects, including creating memory portraits for orphaned children in Africa and Guatemala, helping English as a Second Language speakers acquire English skills, and creating gardens that senior citizens can easily access.</p>
